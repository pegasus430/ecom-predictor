Smartphones have a functionality that is more in-line with most computers than with older cell phones. Almost everyone has a phone with them at all times now, but it can be difficult to figure out which device would be best to purchase. Some shoppers may be turned off by all the extra bells and whistles a smartphone has, but there are still plenty of plain old cell phones available. These devices, now sometimes referred to as \"feature phones,\" can make calls and send texts but have only a few other functions, so users can stay in contact without being distracted by apps and games. By contrast, the market is flooded with different smartphones for consumers who want to buy the most modern gadget available. A varied selection of devices is available, the specifics of which largely depend on which carrier you choose. If the phone you want is not available from your network provider, consider looking at unlocked devices, which are not restricted to any one carrier's frequency. With all the extra features included in smartphones, you may want to buy accessories to make sure your device is reaching its potential. For example, music-streaming subscribers may want to find a pair of Bluetooth-capable headphones so they can listen to all their favorite songs without being wired to their phone. Smartphones are somewhat fragile because of their slim builds and large screens, so a case is necessary to protect the device. There are hard shells and soft body-gloves designed specifically for every make and model. iPhone 5 cases and covers are available, along with enclosures for many other popular models, and are ideal for shoppers who want their new phone to stay in top shape and be protected even if accidentally dropped. Heavier users may require extra chargers, because their phone's battery is unlikely to last through the entire day. Most smartphones can charge via an USB cord, which is perfect for office workers who want to make sure their device will be alive during the commute home. Shoppers can find any phone and accessory to suit their needs. Users should take the time to decide what their expectations are from a device, so they can make a more informed purchase.", "keyword_density": {"cell phones": "1.0", "phones": "2.3"}, "department_id": 7},

Video card improvements move along at breakneck speeds - a new generation of video cards often replaces the old within 3-6 months.

Besides the GPU, the video memory specs (including video memory type, size and clock speed), interface (AGP or PCI Express), and I/O ports are should all be taken into account before purchasing a video card.

If 2011 was the year of the tablet , then 2012 will surely go down as the year of the Ultrabook. Most people aren't yet aware of these remarkable additions to the PC market, but most will come to know just how versatile, powerful and convenient Ultrabooks can be. Some of the best Ultrabooks are already being produced by companies such as Asus, HP, Lenovo, Toshiba, Acer and Samsung. To find the Ultrabook that's right for you, check out our Ultrabook Buying Guide . What is an Ultrabook? The Ultrabook concept, spearheaded by Intel, is essentially the next step in the evolution of netbooks. A netbook is a small, lightweight laptop that has been created with portability in mind. It has no optical drive (for CDs and DVDs) yet features a battery designed to last a long time, so most of its functions are limited to what can be accomplished on the internet. This kind of product is ideal for commuters, travelers and telecommuters who don't need a ton of software or peripheral devices to get work done. An Ultrabook improves upon the netbook by giving users a more complete computing experience. These slim pieces of machinery also come packed with high-powered features, so you don\u2019t have to sacrifice performance for portability and style. Ultrabook Features To actually qualify as an Ultrabook, a PC must meet certain Intel quality standards for speed and processing power. The first generation of Ultrabooks run on Intel\u2019s second generation processors in the Core i3, i5 or i7, depending on what model you choose. And because they use a special low-wattage version of the processors, the new Ultrabooks have a much longer battery life \u2014 a five hour minimum. Ultrabooks vs. Netbooks Ultrabooks take much of the technology of existing laptop PCs and netbooks and improve them in basic ways. In addition to being lightweight like its netbook predecessor, an Ultrabook must be thin. Most weigh less than three pounds and are under an inch thick when closed. Also, the high-definition resolution of an Ultrabook is superior to most monitors available today. However, the biggest difference between an Ultrabook and a netbook is the type of hard drive each one uses. A netbook, despite lacking an optical drive, still has a relatively old-fashioned hard drive disk (HDD). This involves moving parts and requires a fan to cool so it doesn't overheat. Conversely, Ultrabooks feature solid state drive (SSD) technology, which means there are no moving parts inside of it. This is the same type of processing many smartphones and tablets use and makes booting up the Ultrabook a breeze. By using an SSD that has the operating system loaded onto it already, you\u2019ll be powered up and ready to start working within seconds. So instead of hauling around that heavy laptop through airport security and multiple business meetings, why not take a lighter approach? The Ultrabook has the power and battery life needed to carry you through a busy day without weighing you down \u2014 the perfect accessory for your modern, fast-paced lifestyle.", "keyword_density": {"ultrabook": "4.0", "intel": "0.6", "powered": "0.4"}, "department_id": 2},

The console offers access to music, movies, sports, and, of course, video games. It may be a great media hub, but without the right peripheral devices it may be difficult to enjoy the 360's full potential. If you want to go online with the console you need a subscription to Xbox LIVE. The service is offered in monthly increments, so you can decide what time frame meets your needs to avoid wasteful spending on a subscription. If you want to buy any games, movies, or music from Microsoft's online store make sure you have plenty of Microsoft Points. Spare controllers are necessary for gamers who plan on playing with others. Rechargeable batteries and charging stations are available so gamers don't have to find a new pair of AA's every time power is running low. You could also replace the controller with your own movements by adding Kinect to your 360. Adding the motion sensor bar to the console gives you the ability to control your content with gestures and voice commands. While starting a movie by telling your Xbox to \"play disc\" may be convenient, playing games on Kinect may be awkward for some users who need an object to interact with and can't just act out certain activities. For example, a bowling ball replica may make bowling more fun and feel less like a game of charades. Make sure your device is well-connected with all the right wires and cords. Kinect's motion sensor can be moved further away from a television to prevent any motion-related accidents. Finally, don't forget an HDMI cable so all your favorite games, movies and shows are displayed in the highest possible picture quality.", "parent_text": "Video Game Console Accessories", "keyword_density": {"xbox 360": "0.7", "360": "1.0", "xbox": "1.0"}, "department_id": 6},

With streaming services, a built-in Blu-ray player and internet connectivity, there are plenty of ways you can stay entertained with Sony's console. Picking out the right PS3 accessories can create an even better experience while using the device, by enhancing all of its best features. A controller is a basic necessity for every user. Consoles typically only come with one, so having extra controllers is necessary if you want to invite friends to play a game. You can pick and choose from numerous colors. Don't forget to buy a charger, as well. PS3s sync with new controllers via the wired connection, and without it, once a battery dies it's dead for good. For people that use video services but have a hard time searching for movies and TV shows with the on-screen keyboard, there are external keyboards available. You won't have to navigate to different letters with the analog sticks after buying a mini-keyboard that syncs with your PS3. As the Blu-ray player was a major part of the PS3's appeal for many, a remote control may be more intuitive to use than controllers and make on-screen navigation much simpler. Additionally, movies will look even better with a HDMI cable for a higher resolution picture. For gamers who like to play online, a headset may be the perfect accessory to enhance the experience. You can use this tool to strategize with teammates or psych out an opponent during a heated basketball or football game. Buying the right PlayStation 3 accessories can make the console even more fun to use and enhance all your favorite features.", "parent_text": "Video Game Console Accessories", "keyword_density": {"ps3": "1.3", "ps3 accessories": "0.7", "accessories": "0.7"}, "department_id": 6},

By tipping the Wii-mote one way or another, changing the internal gyroscope's orientation, you can partake in a variety of games in a much more immersive way than previous systems could provide. However, some of these movements may feel disjointed and unnatural without the help of certain Wii accessories. Sports games especially benefit from these peripherals. Attachments give the controller a much more realistic feel, so you won't have to suffer a ponderous pantomime when you're trying to golf or play tennis, two of the most popular activities on the console. There are also extra add-ons for bowling, archery and other sports to enhance your gaming experience. Steering wheels are essential for racing games and come in a variety of colors to match your controller. Of course, having a controller in the first place is essential, and the Wii only comes with one white Wii-mote and Nunchuck. The colors and shapes available for the system are much broader than that one option, however. You can mix and match colors and finishes, or even switch out wristbands to totally personalize the look and feel. At the end of the day, don't forget to buy a charging station as well and the right rechargeable batteries, so you can keep getting the best performance from your Wii accessories. Be sure to also buy the right kind of cables as part of your Wii accessories purchase. Some games have high-definition content that you can't fully enjoy without the right composite cables and other attachments. Extension cords and enhanced sensor bars for Wii-mote connectivity can also maximize your gaming experience, giving your console and remotes more reach.", "parent_text": "Video Game Console Accessories", "keyword_density": {"wii accessories": "2.0", "wii": "2.7"}, "department_id": 6},

Whether you want to take on your opponents online or you need to pack up your system and take it with you, we have the accessories you need for a one-of-a-kind gaming experience. Game Cube Accessories Add to the Fun! A GameCube system operates like a computer. It has memory, a central processing unit, and accepts commands from external controllers in the same way your computer accepts commands from a keyboard and mouse. Like a computer, there are several accessories you can purchase for a GameCube. One of the most commonly purchased accessories is an additional controller. Additional controllers make it possible for multiple people to play at the same time. You may also want a wireless controller that lets you play from anywhere in the room. There are also specialty game pads, such as a racer wheel, that are designed to enhance specific games. You can also purchase memory cards for your GameCube. These cards plug into the GameCube and save vital gaming information, such as which levels players have reached, the transactions conducted in sports games, special characters, and current scores. If you're a frequent gamer, you may be interested in a memory card with up to 64 MB of memory. Modern video game systems, like GameCube, are capable of so much more than the Nintendo and Sega of yesteryear. Here at Newegg, we offer numerous GameCube accessories that help maximize your enjoyment of the latest video game technology. Best of all, our prices cannot be beat.

Without a good or at least serviceable sound system, audio content can be distorted and quality can be affected by feedback. Poor playback is especially noticeable while driving, as auto manufacturers don't typically install high-end car speakers. However, drivers can always seek out and install their own devices. The two most important features to look for when buying car speakers are sensitivity and power limits. Sensitivity refers to the sound your speakers produce based on the electricity they receive. Speakers with high sensitivity work best with radios with lower power levels and vice versa. Speakers can produce fuller sounds if they have more features. For instance, a 3-way model has one more driver than a 2-way device, meaning that mid-range sounds are louder. When listening to music, you'll clearly hear background instruments. There are even 4-way speakers that can produce much richer tones than their counterparts. Devices are available in every size and with various settings. You can find the best make and model for your vehicle, so you don't have to return your speakers due to incompatibility. Installing speakers is impossible if you don't have the correct components. Fortunately, there are bundles available that include all the necessary cables so you can easily connect your new speakers with your audio system. These packages are beneficial to budget-conscious drivers who don't want to hire professionals for the relatively simple task. Few people sit in silence on the road. Music is a necessity for most drivers, especially those who like to sing along to their favorite songs while they're in traffic or barreling down empty streets. Speakers play an important part in audio production, so if you want to hear every note clearly you should consider installing new ones in your vehicle.

The car stereo is the device that most people turn to for entertainment during long rides. Whether they listen to news broadcasts or turn up their favorite songs, consumers enjoy hearing something other than their roaring engines and spinning tires. Auto manufacturers don't often put high-end stereos into their vehicles, but any system can be replaced with another that features more components and accessories than standard devices. Most models receive AM and FM signals, but certain radios have different features that not every driver will require. For instance, some models have LCD displays that use touchscreen navigation. These stereos may be more useful to consumers who think it's unsafe to use buttons and knobs while driving. Some devices have DVD players as well, allowing passengers to watch movies or TV shows during those long journeys. Less tech-savvy drivers may prefer radios that resemble their current models but boast increased functionality. Smartphones and MP3 players are commonly used to stream music and podcasts, so consumers may want a gadget that can sync with their mobile devices. Fortunately, radios with connection ports that are compatible with most wires are available. There are also some models with USB slots, while others use headphone jacks. Finally, some car stereos feature docks that ensure your mobile device is secure while you drive. If you don't want to tether your phone to your radio, you should consider a device with Bluetooth compatibility. The wireless technology can be convenient, but keep in mind that it can quickly drain your device's battery. The open road can be a quiet and lonely place, so you need a high quality stereo to listen to your favorite songs and broadcasts. You spend a long time in your car and should enjoy yourself while driving.

No matter where you are located or how lost you are, a GPS receiver will not only pinpoint your location but also tell you exactly where to go. When you make wrong turns, a GPS receiver will recalculate the route for you. Need a gas station? The more advanced receivers can lead you to the nearest one. Here at Newegg, we offer GPS receivers manufactured by the top companies in the industry. Our extensive collection includes receivers at a wide range of prices. Receivers also vary in terms of accuracy, display, and function. Our online catalog provides detailed specifications for all GPS receivers, which makes it easy for you to find something that meets your needs. How to Choose a GPS Receiver Almost all receivers are accurate within 15 meters, but some are even more exact. Another factor to consider is whether you need voice directions. If you frequently drive alone to new places, voice directions are desirable. While many GPS receivers have well-lit LCD displays, it can still be difficult to read while driving. You can always turn the voice off when you do not need it. If you like to measure distances or track your average speed, many GPS receivers can do this for you. And if you take long road trips that include several destinations, you may want a receiver that can store up to 50 locations.

Whether you're looking to totally overhaul your interior and turn it into a performance machine or if you'd just prefer a boost in quality music enjoyment while on the go, car subwoofers will enhance your audio experience. To make your windows rattle, car subwoofers enhance bass quality by amplifying and feeding the audio signal back through an enclosure between 8 and 21 inches in diameter to produce a frequency of 20 to 200 Hz. The lower the frequency, the higher quality the sound will be - and the bigger the beats. The subwoofer will also filter out other frequencies, allowing for better quality and producing a clearer sound. Depending on the quality of your hardware and the inputs you provide it with, you can establish a crossover point where the treble and bass are perfectly balanced, providing the ultimate mix of highs and lows for playback enjoyment. For more balanced output, car subwoofers can give you the ability to fine-tune your listening experience in infinitely more satisfying ways than a standard car audio system right off the factory line can provide. Choosing your own hardware and getting a custom installation can give you the performance and quality you may only otherwise experience at the theater. Combining compact and affordable audio options that are on the level of high-end versions with sophisticated output adjustments, car subwoofers allow you to adjust your audio levels to optimize the listening experience.", "parent_text": "Car Electronics", "keyword_density": {"car": "2.7", "car subwoofers": "3.8"}, "department_id": 10},

As Americans spend more time on the road, we are trying to be as connected to home and the office as possible. Various automotive electronics are available to keep car rides entertaining and safe, while at the same time, providing us with our gadget fix. Automotive In-Car Accessories to Improve Safety and Entertain One example of popular automotive electronics is an audio transmitter that allows you to play music from a flash drive. If you don't have an MP3 player or CD player in your car, but you do have a vehicle and a flash drive, you could use this device to listen to MP3 files through your car stereo. You just need to load up your storage drive with MP3s and plug it into the USB port on the device. Then, you tune your radio into one of the preset FM channels and listen away! Automotive electronics can help enhance safety features, too. Rear view camera systems allow you to see and hear what is behind your vehicle. They have largely replaced rear view mirrors because they have wide-angle lenses and provide a clearer vision than mirrors. Using such a camera helps prevent accidents by allowing you to see a lot more of what's around you. Other automotive electronics that have become popular in the last few years include satellite radio systems, GPS navigation systems, DVD players, and video game systems. Hands-free headsets for cell phones, which have become required by law in many states, add an additional level of safety for those who need to talk and drive at the same time.

With a number of sleek styles and variable options, Bluetooth headsets can integrate with phones, computers, music devices and more to increase ease of use and keep your hands free for more important things. Mono Bluetooth headsets clip over one ear and are useful for walking around in public or taking a call in the car where there are plenty of other things that require your attention. Keeping one ear open will alert you to other conversations or potential situations in your immediate area that require a response and Bluetooth headsets let you do just that without taking away the use of one of your hands. Also, seeing as many U.S. states have laws restricting phone use - including texting and phone calls - while driving, Bluetooth headsets will keep you in touch with friends and co-workers without the risk of getting a ticket or putting other motorists in danger. A stereo Bluetooth headset covers both ears and is useful for playing video games or listening to music. You can go out for a walk or to the gym with your iPod or MP3 player, and not worry about getting a headphone cord tangled on yourself or the workout equipment. You'll be able to get up from your computer and get a drink without taking off your headphones or missing out on a minute of in-game or online chatter. You can even sync it to your game consoles and use it to wirelessly talk to friends on your PS3, XBox or Wii.", "parent_text": "Car Electronics", "keyword_density": {"bluetooth headsets": "2.9", "bluetooth": "1.8"}, "department_id": 10},

The units hold data and spin when users access their content. This process requires a great deal of electricity to function properly, which can cause a delay in the speed with which information is displayed on-screen. Solid state drives (SSDs) are becoming a popular alternative to the factory-installed drives. SSDs resemble HDDs on the outside, but their internal processes don't have much in common. The newer drives don't have any moving parts - unlike hard drives that have two magnetic, spinning plates. There are two key advantages to this structural design - it requires less power and provides faster access to saved data. Because files can be read straight from the SSDs, laptops are able to boot up without delay. Users have individual storage needs, so some might not find one SSD as useful as others. There are some drives with only 32 gigabytes (GB) of space, which may be enough for casual use but not enough to save large libraries or backup entire systems. Luckily, there are SSD deals available for every size unit from various manufacturers. This makes it simple to find the correct piece of equipment for every PC, as the two devices must be compatible to work properly. Some universal drives have brackets allowing them to be installed into various pieces of hardware, regardless of system specifications. Users should be sure they know how to install an SSD before making their purchase. Some drives come bundled with instructional DVDs and manuals that guide amateurs through the installation process step-by-step so they don't accidentally damage their system. Upgrading to a solid state drive from a hard drive can make any computer more efficient and convenient to use.", "parent_text": "SSDs", "keyword_density": {"solid state": "1.3", "drives": "2.3", "solid state drives": "1.0"}, "department_id": 1},

This makes it ideal for devices such as digital cameras where batteries go dead often. With being able to retain data even when power is lost you can rest assured that all your pictures will still be kept safe on the memory card. Examples of flash memory cards include Secure Digital (SD) memory cards, Compact Flash (CF) memory cards, and Sony's Memory Sticks (MS, M2, MS Duo, MS Pro, and MS Pro Duo) to name a few. Other examples of proprietary and permanent flash memory devices include memory cards for video gaming systems. The Benefits of Flash Memory Flash memory is extremely small, fast, lightweight, and makes no noise or have any moving parts, unlike hard drives. However, hard disks can hold considerably more data and its cost per megabyte is much cheaper although prices are quickly dropping as capacity grows larger for flash devices daily. Yet flash memory is quite reliable and allows you to specify which data you want to keep. USB flash drives are known as the floppy disks of the 21st century. You can see people walking around with them dangling from key chains, backpacks, and even around their necks. These are more resistant to physical abuse than the media cards used in digital cameras. They're also an improvement over optical storage like CDs and DVDs, which are easily scratched. Prices of the drives have come down so much that many companies give them to clients instead of printing reports and wasting paper and ink. In some schools, students are required to have them. At Newegg, we stock a wide variety of flash memory.

There are two operating systems - Windows 8 RT and Android - that make tablets even more functional by increasing processor speed and available options. Android tablets are consumer favorites because the software is very similar to the programs used on most smartphones. Users can add apps, games and features with only a couple of taps and gestures. Many people enjoy the familiarity and intuitive-nature of Android. You should always consider your options and find the device that is most suited for your needs. Windows 8 tablets are relatively new, but the devices combine popular features from Microsoft's operating system series with a mobile operating system. The tiled interface bears similarities to the Windows Phone, but it is more customizable and has a wider range of apps. Once you pick the perfect tablet, you'll need the right accessories. Detachable keyboards are a necessity if you want your mobile device to replace your laptop for all of your computing needs. The peripherals are very important if you buy a Windows 8 tablet so you can easily type in programs like Microsoft Word and Excel. Screen covers are among the most important tablet accessories. Tablets have large displays that are susceptible to scratches and scuff marks. You can either buy a plastic cover that blocks out dust or a protective sleeve that also saves prevents the bezel from damage. Some covers also feature keyboards so you can have two accessories in half the space.

While tablets may be lighter, depending on the specific make and model, almost no device can match the functionality and convenience of a portable computer. Buying the right laptop accessories could create an even better user experience by making devices safer and supplementing the hardware. One of a laptop's biggest conveniences is its portability, but it can be awkward to carry in hand and doing so increases the odds of an accident - like being dropped on the sidewalk. A padded backpack can carry a laptop of any size while protecting the device from the elements. Laptop bags and cases are designed to absorb most bumps and bruises, so any valuables stored inside are less likely to be damaged during transit. You might also want to protect your laptop from potential thieves. Putting a lock on a computer would make it difficult for anyone to just walk away with it. Many laptops come with a security slot, so you might want to take advantage of it for additional security measures. Heavier users may find it difficult to find a device that can meet all their demands. A laptop battery can lose power quickly when the machine is asked to handle too many tasks at once. Sometimes there might not be an available outlet, so a power adapter is necessary to provide the extra juice needed to finish an important project before the charge dies. Additionally, most batteries last longer if a laptop does not overheat. Unfortunately, it's easy for a system's internal fan to be obstructed because they are mostly located on the bottom. A cooling pad could supplement a laptop's fans and prevent damage caused by excessive heat. Most of these devices connect via a USB port but have additional outlets so users can still connect flash drives with their computer while the cooling pad is working. Newegg is proud to offer a variety of laptop accessories, including laptop batteries, AC adapters, extended warranties, add-on cards, laptop bags and cases, hard drives, memory, networking devices, luggage & bags, replicators, docking stations and solid state disks.

Nobody wants to mess around with desk microphones with unnecessary feedback or large computer speakers that garble in-game music and distort what other players are saying. Serious gaming requires serious headsets, and finding one that works best for you is what raises your in-game performance. Like standard pairs of headphones , headsets have a variety of styles and sizes. Some have bands that go over the top of the head, others wrap behind and still others do away with bands altogether and clip to ears to avoid stressing the temples. A wireless set may be more up a gamer's alley, as these relieve the exasperation a tethered headset can provide. The real added benefit of a headset comes from the onboard microphone, a feature that not all headsets provide but one that's worth looking for. This function gives you the ability to talk and listen without getting excessive feedback from keyboard or electronic activity, as well as reducing the amount of interference on your end so that other people in your conversation can hear you more easily. As any gamer knows, a successful raid relies partly on good communication, so it's essential that everyone in the party knows who you're dotting before someone kites the group. Headsets come in a variety of colors and styles, and picking the right one with the best additional features will depend on your preferences.

These slim pieces of machinery also come packed with high-powered features, so you don\u2019t have to sacrifice performance for portability and style. Next-generation ultrabooks To actually qualify as an Ultrabook, a PC must meet certain Intel quality standards for speed and processing power. In addition to being lightweight like its netbook predecessor, an Ultrabook must be thin. Most weigh less than three pounds and are under an inch thick when closed. Also, the high-definition resolution of an Ultrabook is superior to most monitors available today. The everlasting battery A short charge is the bane of every laptop user's existence. To combat poor performance and running time, Intel requires ultrabooks to feature at least five hours of battery life. An all-day battery would be a dream come true for most consumers. Currently, the best ultrabooks offer about eight hours of battery life, which would be particularly convenient for users who can't constantly recharge their devices. For instance, college students and traveling businesspeople won't have to worry about their laptops if Intel keeps its promise. Touchscreen may be the future Ultrabooks and tablets are strong competitors among the tech industry mainly because the devices share a great deal of similarities. Both machines are convenient for mobile use and allow users to complete basic tasks. The biggest difference between tablets and ultrabooks is their software. Tablets run on mobile operating systems like Android and iOS, while ultrabooks feature Windows 7. With Windows 8 , however, the gap between the gadgets might close completely. The next-generation of ultrabooks will look completely different from today's computers. Technological innovations and increased performance standards will force manufacturers to build high-quality laptops. If computers with all-day battery life, touchscreen capabilities and 1080p resolution become the standard, then it's difficult to imagine that there are further improvements that manufacturers could make.", "parent_text": "Ultrabooks & Tablets", "keyword_density": {"ultrabook": "3.3"}, "department_id": 2},

Shoppers can find and choose the right Mac hard drive by thinking about storage and portability needs. To figure out what size hard drive you should buy, think about how much computing you do each day and how many files you save. If you're a heavy user, consider buying a drive with terabytes (TB) of available storage. You'll be able to save an entire system to a device with that much room, so if you need a new computer, you will be able to reinstall everything as it was previously. These units are beneficial to people who work in creative industries and have libraries that are too expansive for a single Mac external hard drive. For example, a photographer who has hundreds of thousands of pictures saved on his or her desktop won't be able to back everything up with a smaller unit. Casual consumers should consider drives with a few hundred gigabytes (GB) of space. Buying a device with TBs of data storage would result in a great deal of wasted space for users who only have a couple thousand files that need to be saved. If you plan on bringing your external Mac hard drive everywhere you go, you'll want to purchase a unit that is light and damage-resistant. Some drives are smaller than most tablets, while other devices are large enough to be confused with video game consoles.

CDs and DVDs do not have the capacity to hold PC backups and are not all that convenient. However, the prices of external hard drives have come down so much that they are perfect for backing up your important data. The two most common interfaces for hooking up external drives to your computer are USB and FireWire with eSata now becoming popular also. USB has been around for years and are standard on just about all computers today while FireWire ports are newer and if you use a digital video camera with your computer you probably already have one. In terms of access speeds the latest eSata standard offers the fastest connection however that comes with a price. USB 2.0 and Firewire can cover most of your general needs without having to upgrade your system with a new eSata card. Any of the interfaces will do the job however be sure to purchase an external hard drive with the same type of port that your computer has. Your backup drive should have a capacity at least as big as your computer's largest hard drive. That will leave you with plenty of room to back up your important files or mirror/clone your current drive. You can also buy an external hard drive case and mount an internal hard drive inside it. This method will give you a choice of brands and models, and if anything goes wrong with your internal hard drive, you can simply install the external one inside your computer to replace it. Considerations for External Hard Drives One drawback to using external hard drives for backups is that they are still relatively new for home computer use. They come with Windows drivers; should Windows fail, you will not be able to access your external drive through DOS.

Photos, videos, and digital music have all become so popular in recent years that people need a place to put it all. CDs and DVDs do not have the capacity to hold PC backups and are not all that convenient. However, the prices of external hard drives have come down so much that they are perfect for backing up your important data. The two most common interfaces for hooking up external drives to your computer are USB and FireWire with eSata now becoming popular also. USB has been around for years and are standard on just about all computers today while FireWire ports are newer and if you use a digital video camera with your computer you probably already have one. In terms of access speeds the latest eSata standard offers the fastest connection however that comes with a price. USB 2.0 and Firewire can cover most of your general needs without having to upgrade your system with a new eSata card. Any of the interfaces will do the job however be sure to purchase an external hard drive with the same type of port that your computer has. Your backup drive should have a capacity at least as big as your computer's largest hard drive. That will leave you with plenty of room to back up your important files or mirror/clone your current drive. You can also buy an external hard drive case and mount an internal hard drive inside it. This method will give you a choice of brands and models, and if anything goes wrong with your internal hard drive, you can simply install the external one inside your computer to replace it. Considerations for External Hard Drives One drawback to using external hard drives for backups is that they are still relatively new for home computer use. They come with Windows drivers; should Windows fail, you will not be able to access your external drive through DOS. There are DOS drivers available but they can be difficult to find and most manufacturers do not provide support for them. This isn't a frequent occurrence, just something to keep in mind as you select your external hard drive.", "parent_text": "Ultrabooks", "keyword_density": {"external hard": "4.0", "external hard drives": "3.8", "hard": "3.3", "drives": "1.5", "external": "2.8"}, "department_id": 2},

While tablets may be lighter, depending on the specific make and model, almost no device can match the functionality and convenience of a portable computer. Buying the right laptop accessories could create an even better user experience by making devices safer and supplementing the hardware. One of a laptop's biggest conveniences is its portability, but it can be awkward to carry in hand and doing so increases the odds of an accident - like being dropped on the sidewalk. A padded backpack can carry a laptop of any size while protecting the device from the elements. Laptop bags and cases are designed to absorb most bumps and bruises, so any valuables stored inside are less likely to be damaged during transit. You might also want to protect your laptop from potential thieves. Putting a lock on a computer would make it difficult for anyone to just walk away with it. Many laptops come with a security slot, so you might want to take advantage of it for additional security measures. Heavier users may find it difficult to find a device that can meet all their demands. A laptop battery can lose power quickly when the machine is asked to handle too many tasks at once. Sometimes there might not be an available outlet, so a power adapter is necessary to provide the extra juice needed to finish an important project before the charge dies. Additionally, most batteries last longer if a laptop does not overheat. Unfortunately, it's easy for a system's internal fan to be obstructed because they are mostly located on the bottom. A cooling pad could supplement a laptop's fans and prevent damage caused by excessive heat. Most of these devices connect via a USB port but have additional outlets so users can still connect flash drives with their computer while the cooling pad is working. Newegg is proud to offer a variety of laptop accessories, including laptop batteries, AC adapters, extended warranties, add-on cards, laptop bags and cases, hard drives, memory, networking devices, luggage & bags, replicators, docking stations and solid state disks.

All the equipment needs to be compatible to give an audience the best viewing experience. Due to strides in technology, audio devices can make movies and television shows sound crystal clear, but a standard high-definition television's picture might lag behind a sound system's performance. Buying the best home theater projector could level the playing field. If you're going to be watching a great deal of programming, a projector might be easier on the eyes than an LCD or LED television. The devices are backlit to create a sharper image on screen, while sending light directly into your vision. This is what usually causes eye strain after watching for an extended period of time. Projectors are only directing light toward the screen, making it more comfortable to enjoy a movie marathon. There is more flexibility with a home theater projector, as well. Instead of having a television with a set size, a projector can be adjusted to fill bigger and smaller display areas. Moving the device further away from the screen creates a bigger image, while moving it closer shrinks it. This is a convenient adjustment for users who want to use their device in more than one room. It is important to note the minimum and maximum size settings on each projector, because picture quality will deteriorate if moved beyond those thresholds. You may want to consider the lamp life of a projector before making a purchase. Light bulbs don't last forever, so at some point you'll need to replace one in your device. Most projectors offer settings designed to lengthen a bulb's life, but these options may reduce viewing quality while cutting down on power consumption. It's important to consider all your needs before buying a home theater projector. Make sure you have figured out what you expect from the device and what you'll use it for, so you can buy the best one for your home theater.", "parent_text": "Projectors", "keyword_density": {"home theater": "3.0", "projectors": "0.6"}, "department_id": 2},

All the equipment needs to be compatible to give an audience the best viewing experience. Due to strides in technology, audio devices can make movies and television shows sound crystal clear, but a standard high-definition television's picture might lag behind a sound system's performance. Buying the best home theater projector could level the playing field. If you're going to be watching a great deal of programming, a projector might be easier on the eyes than an LCD or LED television. The devices are backlit to create a sharper image on screen, while sending light directly into your vision. This is what usually causes eye strain after watching for an extended period of time. Projectors are only directing light toward the screen, making it more comfortable to enjoy a movie marathon. There is more flexibility with a home theater projector, as well. Instead of having a television with a set size, a projector can be adjusted to fill bigger and smaller display areas. Moving the device further away from the screen creates a bigger image, while moving it closer shrinks it. This is a convenient adjustment for users who want to use their device in more than one room. It is important to note the minimum and maximum size settings on each projector, because picture quality will deteriorate if moved beyond those thresholds. You may want to consider the lamp life of a projector before making a purchase. Light bulbs don't last forever, so at some point you'll need to replace one in your device. Most projectors offer settings designed to lengthen a bulb's life, but these options may reduce viewing quality while cutting down on power consumption. It's important to consider all your needs before buying a home theater projector. Make sure you have figured out what you expect from the device and what you'll use it for, so you can buy the best one for your home theater.", "parent_text": "Projectors", "keyword_density": {"home theater": "3.0", "projectors": "0.6"}, "department_id": 2},

You need something with enough power to function almost the way a laptop would, but without the bulk and setup of that sort of device. A tablet, such as the ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity Tablet PC can offer portability and flexibility, with built-in media devices and a range of services that make it as handy as it is easy to handle. Tablets come in a range of sizes and shapes, either with Wi-Fi connectivity or through a dedicated provider like Sprint, AT&T or Verizon. These services require a regular contract like a mobile phone, but they can also get online anywhere and at any time, much like a smartphone can. This will provide the kind of overall use that professionals and casual users alike can truly appreciate. Available in a range of sizes, picking a screen size is only the first step in choosing the device that's right for you. As the advent of Ivy Bridge revolutionizes the computing power of ultra-slim devices , the best tablets are able to process more than some laptops at this point without having to tote around bulky or heavy tools. The largest tablets are about 10 inches across - similar in size to a netbook - yet lacking the external keyboard or hinged shell. Some of these have front-facing as well as rear-facing cameras, meaning you can chat online or take pictures and video with a larger mobile device, and then simply upload the content straight to the internet. Peripherals for tablets are as smart, sleek and small as the devices they're designed to support. In some cases the covers that snap over the screen are actually the keyboards themselves, and mice can fold flat or slip right into the same bag as a tablet without any noticeable change in weight or profile. For users in search of a powerful mobile computing experience, tablet computers may be even be able to replace a cell phone or smartphone, providing all the same features in a single utility.", "parent_text": "Tablets", "keyword_density": {"tablets": "1.1"}, "department_id": 2},

Many people enjoy the familiarity and intuitive-nature of Android. You should always consider your options and find the device that is most suited for your needs. Windows 8 tablets are relatively new, but the devices combine popular features from Microsoft's operating system series with a mobile operating system. The tiled interface bears similarities to the Windows Phone, but it is more customizable and has a wider range of apps. Once you pick the perfect tablet, you'll need the right accessories. Detachable keyboards are a necessity if you want your mobile device to replace your laptop for all of your computing needs. The peripherals are very important if you buy a Windows 8 tablet so you can easily type in programs like Microsoft Word and Excel. Screen covers are among the most important tablet accessories. Tablets have large displays that are susceptible to scratches and scuff marks. You can either buy a plastic cover that blocks out dust or a protective sleeve that also saves prevents the bezel from damage.

While tablets may be lighter, depending on the specific make and model, almost no device can match the functionality and convenience of a portable computer. Buying the right laptop accessories could create an even better user experience by making devices safer and supplementing the hardware. One of a laptop's biggest conveniences is its portability, but it can be awkward to carry in hand and doing so increases the odds of an accident - like being dropped on the sidewalk. A padded backpack can carry a laptop of any size while protecting the device from the elements. Laptop bags and cases are designed to absorb most bumps and bruises, so any valuables stored inside are less likely to be damaged during transit. You might also want to protect your laptop from potential thieves. Putting a lock on a computer would make it difficult for anyone to just walk away with it. Many laptops come with a security slot, so you might want to take advantage of it for additional security measures. Heavier users may find it difficult to find a device that can meet all their demands. A laptop battery can lose power quickly when the machine is asked to handle too many tasks at once. Sometimes there might not be an available outlet, so a power adapter is necessary to provide the extra juice needed to finish an important project before the charge dies. Additionally, most batteries last longer if a laptop does not overheat. Unfortunately, it's easy for a system's internal fan to be obstructed because they are mostly located on the bottom. A cooling pad could supplement a laptop's fans and prevent damage caused by excessive heat. Most of these devices connect via a USB port but have additional outlets so users can still connect flash drives with their computer while the cooling pad is working. Newegg is proud to offer a variety of laptop accessories, including laptop batteries, AC adapters, extended warranties, add-on cards, laptop bags and cases, hard drives, memory, networking devices, luggage & bags, replicators, docking stations and solid state disks.

These slim pieces of machinery also come packed with high-powered features, so you don\u2019t have to sacrifice performance for portability and style. Next-generation ultrabooks To actually qualify as an Ultrabook, a PC must meet certain Intel quality standards for speed and processing power. In addition to being lightweight like its netbook predecessor, an Ultrabook must be thin. Most weigh less than three pounds and are under an inch thick when closed. Also, the high-definition resolution of an Ultrabook is superior to most monitors available today. The everlasting battery A short charge is the bane of every laptop user's existence. To combat poor performance and running time, Intel requires ultrabooks to feature at least five hours of battery life. An all-day battery would be a dream come true for most consumers. Currently, the best ultrabooks offer about eight hours of battery life, which would be particularly convenient for users who can't constantly recharge their devices. For instance, college students and traveling businesspeople won't have to worry about their laptops if Intel keeps its promise. Touchscreen may be the future Ultrabooks and tablets are strong competitors among the tech industry mainly because the devices share a great deal of similarities. Both machines are convenient for mobile use and allow users to complete basic tasks. The biggest difference between tablets and ultrabooks is their software. Tablets run on mobile operating systems like Android and iOS, while ultrabooks feature Windows 7. With Windows 8 , however, the gap between the gadgets might close completely. The next-generation of ultrabooks will look completely different from today's computers. Technological innovations and increased performance standards will force manufacturers to build high-quality laptops. If computers with all-day battery life, touchscreen capabilities and 1080p resolution become the standard, then it's difficult to imagine that there are further improvements that manufacturers could make.", "parent_text": "PCs & Laptops", "keyword_density": {"ultrabook": "3.3"}, "department_id": 3},

Traditional notebooks , on the other hand, are more unique than their slim counterparts because companies don't have to adhere to the universal code. The devices offer high-quality performance and strong computing power. Additionally, laptops feature important components like optical drives that ultrabooks often lack. Manufacturers aren't resting on their laurels when it comes to laptops. In 2013, consumers can expect to see some groundbreaking hardware that may change the face mobile computing.

In addition, desktop PCs still allow for extensive upgrades to be performed, allowing you to make the most out of your investment. .SEOContent_TableAlignment td {vertical-align: top;} #bcaShopWindowSEO a { color: blue; text-decoration: underline; } #bcaShopWindowSEO a:active { color: red; } #bcaShopWindowSEO a:visited { color: purple; } #bcaShopWindowSEO a:hover { border: none; } .seo { color: #202020; line-height: 125%; font-family: calibri, verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;}.seo h2 { font-weight: bold; color: #043566; font-size: 14pt !important; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-top: 0px;}.seo h3 { font-weight: bold; color: #043566; font-size: 11pt !important; margin-bottom: 5px;}.seo p { margin-top: 0px; }/** Box Sizing **/.column_left { width: 47%; padding-right: 3%; float: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; }.column_right { width: 47%; padding-left: 3%; float: right; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; } Traditionally, a desktop PC meant a large tower coupled with a monitor. Desktop PCs now have towers that range from full-size to compact, with some no more than a foot tall. There are even all-in-one PCs that eliminate the tower by combining the monitor and tower into one compact unit, which can free up some space in a crowded office. A Desktop PC that will be used for general office administration and word processing will not need huge amounts of processing power, and an octa-core processor is usually not required. Find a workable balance where the processor is powerful enough for the tasks you intend to use it for. Solid state drives are very popular, but not all Desktop PCs will need the increased read and access times that they provide. Consider getting solid state drives for desktop PC that require fast read and write speeds for specialized jobs or fast boot speeds. Otherwise, a traditional hard drive will be sufficient for most tasks. Most desktop PCs used for general administrative tasks and word processing will not require dedicated graphics cards, so you can reduce costs by purchasing desktop PCs with onboard video. However, an exception may be made for business-grade graphics cards if your organization is purchasing a desktop PC for design, simulation, rendering, or any other graphics related tasks. Also, if the tasks that the desktop PC will be performing require a lot of screen space, consider getting a desktop PC with a capable of outputting video to multiple displays to improve productivity and efficiency. Many basic desktop pc come with DVD writers, which should be sufficient for general use, but you can always add a Blu-ray drive if it is required for the tasks that the desktop PC will be doing. Keep those key points in mind when shopping for a desktop PC and you will find one that fulfills its role and fits your organization\u2019s budget. Avoid over-spending by buying one with specifications that are above and beyond what is needed. The ideal desktop PC should be sufficient for its function without being unnecessarily expensive and laden with necessary features.", "parent_text": "PCs & Laptops", "keyword_density": {"desktop pcs": "2.5", "pcs": "1.4", "desktop": "3.3"}, "department_id": 3},

While tablets may be lighter, depending on the specific make and model, almost no device can match the functionality and convenience of a portable computer. Buying the right laptop accessories could create an even better user experience by making devices safer and supplementing the hardware. One of a laptop's biggest conveniences is its portability, but it can be awkward to carry in hand and doing so increases the odds of an accident - like being dropped on the sidewalk. A padded backpack can carry a laptop of any size while protecting the device from the elements. Laptop bags and cases are designed to absorb most bumps and bruises, so any valuables stored inside are less likely to be damaged during transit. You might also want to protect your laptop from potential thieves. Putting a lock on a computer would make it difficult for anyone to just walk away with it. Many laptops come with a security slot, so you might want to take advantage of it for additional security measures. Heavier users may find it difficult to find a device that can meet all their demands. A laptop battery can lose power quickly when the machine is asked to handle too many tasks at once. Sometimes there might not be an available outlet, so a power adapter is necessary to provide the extra juice needed to finish an important project before the charge dies. Additionally, most batteries last longer if a laptop does not overheat. Unfortunately, it's easy for a system's internal fan to be obstructed because they are mostly located on the bottom. A cooling pad could supplement a laptop's fans and prevent damage caused by excessive heat. Most of these devices connect via a USB port but have additional outlets so users can still connect flash drives with their computer while the cooling pad is working. Newegg is proud to offer a variety of laptop accessories, including laptop batteries, AC adapters, extended warranties, add-on cards, laptop bags and cases, hard drives, memory, networking devices, luggage & bags, replicators, docking stations and solid state disks.

In the past year, numerous high-profile titles have been released to wide acclaim from both critics and casual players. That said, plenty of computer gamers are just as dedicated to the classics - if not more so - than the newest games available. Luckily, we've got classics, new favorites and everything in between. Fans of first-person shooters or similarly combat-heavy games will certainly have plenty of options on their hands. As far as genres go, these action-packed titles run the gamut from Renaissance-era swashbuckling and sci-fi dystopia to modern warfare and crime sagas. Additionally, intense role-playing games (RPGs) and real-time strategy (RTS) titles are available. Options in this category include games from established franchises like Diablo, Starcraft and Age of Empires to newer favorite series such as Fallout and The Elder Scrolls. However, those games aren't for everyone, and some are rated either T for Teen or M for Mature - intended for adults and teenagers of a certain age and maturity level. Parents, never fear - we've got plenty of other options for younger gamers and those uninterested in combat. These also encompass a wide variety of genres, as you could be creating entire new worlds in games like The Sims, planning culinary domination in Restaurant Empire or testing your wits with puzzle- and gambling-themed titles. You'll even have no trouble finding sports games or options that are suitable for even the youngest players.

Netbooks first appeared as an answer to the mobility provided by the iPhone and enjoyed, however briefly, massive popularity. One of the closest relatives to the netbook is the Chromebook. Developed initially by Google, the Chromebook is a small laptop optimized for use with the Internet. While it may seem \"pidgeon-holed\" by its Google designation, many other manufacturers have seen promise in the device, developing their own Chromebooks and generating massive interest for a laptop in the age of tablets . How Chromebook works, what it does To be designated a Chromebook, a laptop must be running Chrome OS, which is essentially a variation of the Chrome web browser that allows for work to be done offline. Supplemented by small, fast flash storage, the cloud does most of the work for these machines. By serving more as a portal to the Internet and as less of an operating system, Chromebook users avoid constant security updates, out-of-date hardware and the sluggishness that comes with an aging system - new versions of the browser are the only system maintenance that needs to be addressed. Without a hard drive, Chromebooks experience fast boot times and enjoy extended battery life when compared to traditional laptops. Proponents of these computers praise it for its streamlined capabilities and ease of use. This sort of technology is perfect for students, and Dell 's first foray into Chromebook development was fueled by how it could be used in classrooms. Other manufacturers Google may have created it and coined its name off their own web browser, but other companies like Dell are also putting big money into the Chromebook game. Taiwanese company Acer has even developed a touchscreen unit, continuing to bridge the gap between laptops and tablets (Google has also created a touchscreen version of their Chromebook called the Pixel). Longtime computer giants HP and Samsung are some other of the notable names to also dip their toes into the market's waters. Chromebooks Affordability Chromebooks, like the netbooks that came before them, also receive admiration for their cost-effectiveness. With the notable exception of Google's new Pixel (over $1,000), most units are well under $300, making them great for productivity on a budget and ideal for students or as secondary machines to laptops that have more processing power. If all that is needed out of a laptop is some streaming, browsing, organizing and writing, and a tablet is not going to cut it, then a Chromebook may be a perfect solution.", "parent_text": "PCs & Laptops", "keyword_density": {"chromebook": "3.0"}, "department_id": 3},

Whether you need speakers for the outdoors, a television room, or to hear your stereo throughout the house, you can find great audio equipment in our online catalog. As with all of our home electronics, our speakers are not only state of the art but also well-priced. You will not find superior value anywhere on the Internet. How to Choose Speakers The key to choosing the right speakers is understanding what the specifications mean. The most basic detail is the configuration, which is expressed as 2.0, 2.1, 4.1, and so on. The first digit refers to how many speakers come with the set, and the numeral to the right of the decimal point refers to how many subwoofers come with the system. A subwoofer provides a strong bass that many standard speakers are incapable of playing. Another factor to consider is sensitivity, which is measured in decibels (dB). Highly sensitive speakers (anything over 92 dB) can produce clear, high-volume sound without much amplifier power. Speakers with less than 88 dB are considered inefficient; sound will be distorted on these speakers without the help of a high-quality amplifier. Frequency response is also important. Ideally, you want speakers that can reproduce the entire spectrum of audible frequencies. The lowest frequency detectable by the human ear is 20 Hz, and the highest is 20,000 Hz, or 20 kHz. If speakers cannot play something as low as 20 Hz, the only way to hear everything you are supposed to hear is by purchasing a subwoofer. What about Watts?Unless you plan on hosting a heavy metal concert in your backyard, you will probably never blow your speakers regardless of the amplifier you use. Distortion causes blown speakers far more often than volume. To avoid blown speakers, never exceed the recommended wattage on your amplifiers. This will prevent distortion. By playing music at a comfortable listening level without distortion, your speakers will be just fine.

If you want to use your router as a firewall also, make sure you purchase one that has a built-in firewall. Otherwise, you can purchase a firewall separately. Wireless network routers will allow you to connect computers, notebook computers, PDAs and printers without wires. They are also useful for connecting laptops to the Internet and other networks, such as at work or at home. If you want to use a wireless network router, you need to have a wireless network adapter installed in any computer that you connect to your network. If these are not already in the computers, you'll need to purchase them and add them in. To network your home computers to each other, you can use an access point instead, but we recommend routers because you can also use them for Internet sharing and firewall security. Also, home routers tend to be less expensive than access points. The Importance of Security with Wireless Network Routers Security is especially important when using a wireless network. Basically, anybody within the range of your network who has the right equipment can access it. It is very easy for them to use a network detection program to access your network. Therefore, use WEC or MAC address filtering. This is a unique hardware identifier that gives each network device its own identity. WEP, or Wireless Encryption Protocol, is another way to identify your network devices.

Shoppers can find and choose the right Mac hard drive by thinking about storage and portability needs. To figure out what size hard drive you should buy, think about how much computing you do each day and how many files you save. If you're a heavy user, consider buying a drive with terabytes (TB) of available storage. You'll be able to save an entire system to a device with that much room, so if you need a new computer, you will be able to reinstall everything as it was previously. These units are beneficial to people who work in creative industries and have libraries that are too expansive for a single Mac external hard drive. For example, a photographer who has hundreds of thousands of pictures saved on his or her desktop won't be able to back everything up with a smaller unit. Casual consumers should consider drives with a few hundred gigabytes (GB) of space. Buying a device with TBs of data storage would result in a great deal of wasted space for users who only have a couple thousand files that need to be saved. If you plan on bringing your external Mac hard drive everywhere you go, you'll want to purchase a unit that is light and damage-resistant. Some drives are smaller than most tablets, while other devices are large enough to be confused with video game consoles.

While tablets may be lighter, depending on the specific make and model, almost no device can match the functionality and convenience of a portable computer. Buying the right laptop accessories could create an even better user experience by making devices safer and supplementing the hardware. One of a laptop's biggest conveniences is its portability, but it can be awkward to carry in hand and doing so increases the odds of an accident - like being dropped on the sidewalk. A padded backpack can carry a laptop of any size while protecting the device from the elements. Laptop bags and cases are designed to absorb most bumps and bruises, so any valuables stored inside are less likely to be damaged during transit. You might also want to protect your laptop from potential thieves. Putting a lock on a computer would make it difficult for anyone to just walk away with it. Many laptops come with a security slot, so you might want to take advantage of it for additional security measures. Heavier users may find it difficult to find a device that can meet all their demands. A laptop battery can lose power quickly when the machine is asked to handle too many tasks at once. Sometimes there might not be an available outlet, so a power adapter is necessary to provide the extra juice needed to finish an important project before the charge dies. Additionally, most batteries last longer if a laptop does not overheat. Unfortunately, it's easy for a system's internal fan to be obstructed because they are mostly located on the bottom. A cooling pad could supplement a laptop's fans and prevent damage caused by excessive heat. Most of these devices connect via a USB port but have additional outlets so users can still connect flash drives with their computer while the cooling pad is working. Newegg is proud to offer a variety of laptop accessories, including laptop batteries, AC adapters, extended warranties, add-on cards, laptop bags and cases, hard drives, memory, networking devices, luggage & bags, replicators, docking stations and solid state disks.

Attaching a device to a port replicator is a solution for those who need the extra outlets and hardware support.

Manufacturers have begun producing slimmer models of both devices at the expense of some features that users may need, like ethernet jacks or HDMI ports. For those who have replaced their desktop with a laptop or tablet, this lack of hardware support can be a problem. Attaching a device to a port replicator is a solution for those who need the extra outlets and hardware support. Port replicators connect to a laptop or tablet via the battery hook-up, so the peripheral acts as a base for the device. Some tablet stations include an external keyboard for consumers who don't like typing on the screen, while others may need extra USB slots to connect with other accessories. Many ultrabooks don't have a CD drive, but some laptop docking stations have disc readers if you need to access content from CDs and DVDs. Other models offer ethernet connections, USB ports and audio jacks but lack a disc reader. You can pick and choose which features you need to supplement your laptop's functionality. Port replicators can be quickly disconnected so a device is never tethered to a desk. Users can connect all peripheral devices, like external hard drives and printers, to a base so instead of unplugging multiple accessories only the docking station needs to be removed from a tablet or laptop. This convenient accessory is great for workers who bring their mobile computers to work each day. A slim device doesn't have to lack the functionality found in desktops and heavier machines.

A standard set of side-by-side speakers will let you hear what's happening more clearly than using an onboard sound device. Without a tool like this, you may not get any audio with your playback at all, so this should be considered a basic purchase to go along with upgrading a keyboard and mouse.

Something with a subwoofer and additional high-powered speakers can make it feel like you have a surround sound experience in your computer chair. Purchasing a speaker system also means considering how these will be connected. Some systems have USB hook-ups or other plugs and cables that won't require as many dedicated sockets, but there are expanders and other solutions to increase the maximum number of USB devices you can have going at once. Some devices will also be able to pull power right from the computer they're attached to, but in some cases they have a dedicated power supply that will need its own wall outlet. You may need to buy a separate power strip on top of speakers to make sure the entire system will function correctly.

High-level webcams, on the other hand, produce fluid streaming video and can be used for business conferences, surveillance, and home security. Reading the Specifications of Webcams Available at Newegg One of the most telling specifications of any webcam is the frame rate. This measures how many frames the camera captures every second. When a camera records just one frame per second (fps), the video appears very choppy. You will see very little correspondence between the person's mouth and the words he or she is speaking. A webcam with a frame rate of 30 fps, on the other hand, will produce video almost as fluid as a television broadcast. Another important measurement is effective pixels. The more effective pixels your web cam has, the clearer the image will be. The most basic webcams produce good images, but viewers may not be able to discern certain details. Features that should appear curved may look rectangular. 1.3 MP or more of effective pixels is ideal however lower amounts of pixels will work for most general purposes.", "parent_text": "Input Devices", "keyword_density": {"webcams": "2.3"}, "department_id": 3},

Most people use their computers as gateways to the internet, so it can be frustrating if they can't go online because they can't find an ethernet cable. Consumers can buy wireless cards for laptops so their devices can connect with a signal from anywhere. These cards need to be installed to a computer's motherboard to use a wireless signal. Many of the available models come with tutorials and instruction guides, so even shoppers who aren't tech-savvy can easily install their new purchase. Laptop wireless cards act as internal receivers, allowing a computer to connect to the internet over the air without an ethernet cord. Users who are on the go need this added convenience so their devices can be fully functional anywhere there's a wireless signal. For example, college students can install a card so their laptops work in class and in the library - not just in their dorm rooms or apartments. A laptop must be within a certain proximity to a Wi-Fi router to receive the signal, as the card itself does not generate web connectivity. Fortunately, many establishments, ranging from coffee shops to public libraries, provide wireless web access, so everyone can find a place to go online. For users who want to add an ethernet connection to their notebook, there are cards with jacks for cords. Manufacturers have begun producing slim laptops that remove ethernet ports to reduce the devices' overall weight. Much like a wireless card, these units are installed internally but have an external attachment intended for a wired connection. You should make sure the wireless card you're thinking about purchasing matches your computer's hardware specifications. Access points must have driver support to function properly, so be sure to check what your system is capable of supporting.", "parent_text": "Laptop Accessories", "keyword_density": {"wireless": "2.2", "cards": "1.3", "laptop": "1.9", "wireless cards": "1.3", "laptop wireless cards": "1.0"}, "department_id": 3},

You have a half-dozen computers working together, sending and receiving documents, collaborating on projects, communicating quickly and easily without the interference and lag of a general connection, and you're confident that your network is running properly. Then, you realize that you have to print something. Getting printers set up and accessible within a network structure can be frustrating, especially when working with remote servers and accessing machines, but print servers can assist with getting these devices working more quickly. Whether wired or wireless, these devices plug in to printer network connection ports, granting usage for authorized users and those within the system. As not every manufacturer makes printers compatible with every kind of network or every other print device on the market, a print server can override this incompatibility, making a device usable as long as it has the right adapter. It's also great for offices with multiple printers. A network can host so many machines that it's cumbersome to have all print jobs routed to the same printer, especially when a device is built to handle multiple functions. A printer can also be a scanner, copier and fax machine, making it necessary to have more than one machine to fit unit-task needs, so routing them all into a single client can make it easy for users in a vast network to select a device that's not busy. This also helps when one of these printers inevitably gets jammed. Print servers hook devices into a network in a way that makes them most useful to the greatest number of users. These devices are affordable and easy to install, increase the productivity and flexibility of those working with them and can help make an office a much saner place to work.", "parent_text": "Printers / Scanners & Supplies", "keyword_density": {"printer": "2.2", "servers": "0.9"}, "department_id": 3},

However, not all PCs come equipped with sound cards that can produce the type of audio you want. If you use a computer as a home theater, music player, or gaming system, it is ideal to have the capability for 5.1 surround sound. 5.1 means there are five speakers and one subwoofer. Sound cards send different audio signals to each of the five speakers, so the speakers all play a different portion of the overall sound. Rather than simply hearing the audio from a computer, a listener becomes immersed in whatever is playing. This intensifies the video gaming experience and enhances your enjoyment of music and movies. Sound Card Features to Look for If you plan on using a computer to record or play music, consider purchasing a sound card with MIDI. MIDI is a standard for connecting electronic musical instruments. Having MIDI is especially helpful to musicians who like to write and record their own songs. With the right software programs and a sound card with MIDI, it is possible for one musician to play five different instruments (one at a time) and then overlap the recordings together to make one song on the computer. Other important sound card specifications include whether or not the card has a microphone plug, and the operating systems that can read the card. It is especially important to check this latter detail if you are using an older operating system. Some of the newer sound cards only work with newer operating systems.

You can take notebooks anywhere as long as the battery is fully charged or there's an electrical outlet available to serve as a power source. Unfortunately, laptop batteries degrade over time - they store less electricity and die faster as they age. Even the best power supplies start to wear down after months of consistent use. For laptops that have a removable battery, it's easy find a replacement unit. If you know the make and model of your laptop, you can find the right battery easily. Because computers have different connection ports, it's important to find the power supply built specifically for your line of laptop. Some manufacturers offer universal batteries for notebooks that they no longer produce or support. A functioning AC adapter is another necessity for every computer, as no battery can last more than a few hours on a single charge. Like the batteries, it's important to find a compatible laptop charger for a notebook's electrical jack. Some users bring their laptops everywhere - from home to work or school and everywhere in between. Chargers can wear out from being repeatedly unplugged, and if they break there's no way to keep the notebooks they are connected to from losing power. Having a backup on hand in case of emergencies eliminates any unnecessary stress caused by waiting for a replacement. For added convenience, use one as a travel charger and leave the other at home, so you don't have to constantly unplug an adapter every time you go out. Until computer companies invent and produce everlasting batteries, it's important to have the necessary electrical equipment for a laptop.

The units hold data and spin when users access their content. This process requires a great deal of electricity to function properly, which can cause a delay in the speed with which information is displayed on-screen. Solid state drives (SSDs) are becoming a popular alternative to the factory-installed drives. SSDs resemble HDDs on the outside, but their internal processes don't have much in common. The newer drives don't have any moving parts - unlike hard drives that have two magnetic, spinning plates. There are two key advantages to this structural design - it requires less power and provides faster access to saved data. Because files can be read straight from the SSDs, laptops are able to boot up without delay. Users have individual storage needs, so some might not find one SSD as useful as others. There are some drives with only 32 gigabytes (GB) of space, which may be enough for casual use but not enough to save large libraries or backup entire systems. Luckily, there are SSD deals available for every size unit from various manufacturers. This makes it simple to find the correct piece of equipment for every PC, as the two devices must be compatible to work properly. Some universal drives have brackets allowing them to be installed into various pieces of hardware, regardless of system specifications. Users should be sure they know how to install an SSD before making their purchase.

Or, you have a laptop and want to use it with your home computer's keyboard, mouse and monitor, without changing your current setup. The answer lies in a handy device called a KVM switch. KVM stands for keyboard, video, mouse. The keyboard, video, and mouse set collectively is called a \"console.\" KVM switches allow you to connect a console to more than one computer. You simply connect your console cables to the output jacks of the switch and connect the switch to the connections on your computer that the keyboard mouse and monitor would normally be plugged into. It's that simple. KVM Switches Let You Switch between Consoles To switch consoles, you just push a button on the switch and it allows you to use the other console. KVM switches save you money because you won't have to purchase separate keyboards, mice, and monitors for each computer you use. It makes it very easy when one person uses more than one computer at work, for example. They are also useful for server farms with one staff person accessing each computer periodically, one at a time. When buying KVM switches, it is important to fully understand your needs before you buy anything. Make sure the switch you choose will support your monitor refresh rates and resolution so that the signals are not degraded.", "parent_text": "Input Devices", "keyword_density": {"kvm": "2.4", "kvm switches": "3.2"}, "department_id": 3},

The computer keyboard is an input device that sends commands and text inputs to the computer, and is the main interface that we use to communicate or control the computer in combination with the mouse. Unfortunately, not every computer's keyboard is comfortable and sturdy. Without these two characteristics, productivity may decline as working becomes a hassle and can even be painful. You may believe that your typing technique requires improvement, but more often than not faulty hardware is the root of your discomfort. Not every model has wrist supports and you can hurt your arms while you type without assistance. Ergonomic keyboards are designed to help you use your computer without any pain. These models have larger bases, letting you rest your wrists and palms while typing. Instead of uncomfortably hovering over your keyboard, your hands have the necessary support to prevent any strain and reduce the likelihood of developing physical ailments like carpal tunnel syndrome. Pads are commonly found on gaming keyboards as those are meant for more casual use. During a marathon game session, players must usually enter a great deal of key commands. With a standard keyboard, this can lead to pain or discomfort, as their hands continually move without support or rest. Some gaming models, by contrast, have features that can improve a gamer's performance as well. Wireless keyboards are also available - these ensure that users aren't tethered to their desks. If you have a large enough screen, you can use your device while sitting away from your computer. Working without wires also allows you to find a relaxed position, so you aren't confined to a single table. Buying a new keyboard can improve your typing proficiency, whether you're writing a term paper or playing a video game. The right device can raise your comfort levels while also making it easier to use your computer through key commands. Brands featured at Newegg include Microsoft, KeyTronic, Adesso, Logitech and many others. Available in multiple styles and versions you can find one to suit your unique needs rather it's multimedia, gaming, or just looking for the latest new thing. At Newegg you'll find what you need.

If a consumer wants to connect multiple accessories, they might have to choose between which ones have the most relevant functionality and which are expendable for the time being. This is an inconvenience for those who need their devices to work efficiently and accommodate all needs. If you have too many accessories and not enough docks, a USB hub will provide the additional support you need. A hub uses one USB port on the computer itself but provides multiple ports that link with other devices - much the way a power strip creates additional electrical outlets by working from one. After purchasing a network hub, every peripheral device can stay connected to a laptop. You can connect an external hard drive, DVD burner, printer and smartphone to a computer via a single USB connection and still have extra space for more accessories. Users can leave all their peripherals attached to the hub for more convenient connection and detachment. Instead of unplugging multiple items, consumers only have to remove a USB hub's plug. This is perfect for those who need their computers to travel, such as college students who bring their notebooks to class or workers who need their laptops in the office. There are different styles of plugs to meet the needs of every shopper. Some ports are large and have over 10 USB slots so they might be best utilized in a stationary environment, while others only feature a couple of access points for more mobile use. Other network hubs are just a series of wires so consumers don't have to carry a bulky device. Peripheral accessories help users enjoy their laptops' best features.

For artists and graphic designers, a drawing tablet might be the best option. These devices are basically digital sketchbooks. Instead of drawing a design or an image and then recreating it on a laptop, a graphics tablet comes equipped with software so users can create their artwork, save it and share the file with other devices via an internet or wired connection. There are pen tablets available for designers who aren't quite ready to make the leap to touchscreen technology. Most of these devices' screens are sensitive enough that they'll respond to the pen in natural way to create different shades, styles and lines. If you aren't comfortable with the pen that a tablet came packaged with, there are other peripherals available. You can shop around until you find the pen that feels most comfortable in your hand. There are replacement parts available for some pens, which could be useful if you're worried that you'll quickly wear out your drawing tool. Consumers who don't want to untangle wires every time they need to share a new file with another device should consider buying a wireless connection kit. A USB wireless connector enables sharing with any PC, even if the design tablet was not built with wireless sharing. Don't forget to buy a carrying case, so your device is well-protected during transport. Screens are very sensitive and will be susceptible to scratches and scuff marks if left exposed to the elements.

However, not all PCs come equipped with sound cards that can produce the type of audio you want. If you use a computer as a home theater, music player, or gaming system, it is ideal to have the capability for 5.1 surround sound. 5.1 means there are five speakers and one subwoofer. Sound cards send different audio signals to each of the five speakers, so the speakers all play a different portion of the overall sound. Rather than simply hearing the audio from a computer, a listener becomes immersed in whatever is playing. This intensifies the video gaming experience and enhances your enjoyment of music and movies. Sound Card Features to Look for If you plan on using a computer to record or play music, consider purchasing a sound card with MIDI. MIDI is a standard for connecting electronic musical instruments. Having MIDI is especially helpful to musicians who like to write and record their own songs. With the right software programs and a sound card with MIDI, it is possible for one musician to play five different instruments (one at a time) and then overlap the recordings together to make one song on the computer. Other important sound card specifications include whether or not the card has a microphone plug, and the operating systems that can read the card. It is especially important to check this latter detail if you are using an older operating system. Some of the newer sound cards only work with newer operating systems.

Paying for an international call isn't necessary if you have a USB mic for your PC or laptop, making talking to anyone around the world as easy as turning on the device. These gadgets connect quickly and easily, are functional with any computer and provide unlimited high-quality audio to anyone you can connect with. These are also handy for online gaming with programs like Ventrillo, which allow for in-game communication, so long as you have the right technology on your end. Built-in microphones just don't offer the same quality as an external USB microphone, with enhanced clarity and sound customization that gives them superior performance to a base-level device. If you've ever wanted to do audio and sound work with your computer or electrical instruments, these are essential for getting studio-grade results. The more upscale models still offer the same plug-and-play connectivity, but with automatic level adjustment, analog controls and signal muting, some rival even professional-grade tools. A USB microphone of high caliber frees you from the anchor of a computer, letting you set it up with a wired or wireless connection to provide the best possible customization and function. Whether you're chatting with a friend on Skype, owning noobs in World of Warcraft or cutting a new album with your garage band, microphones that come attached to your computer just won't give you the same level of performance that a USB microphone can provide.

The units hold data and spin when users access their content. This process requires a great deal of electricity to function properly, which can cause a delay in the speed with which information is displayed on-screen. Solid state drives (SSDs) are becoming a popular alternative to the factory-installed drives. SSDs resemble HDDs on the outside, but their internal processes don't have much in common. The newer drives don't have any moving parts - unlike hard drives that have two magnetic, spinning plates. There are two key advantages to this structural design - it requires less power and provides faster access to saved data. Because files can be read straight from the SSDs, laptops are able to boot up without delay. Users have individual storage needs, so some might not find one SSD as useful as others. There are some drives with only 32 gigabytes (GB) of space, which may be enough for casual use but not enough to save large libraries or backup entire systems. Luckily, there are SSD deals available for every size unit from various manufacturers. This makes it simple to find the correct piece of equipment for every PC, as the two devices must be compatible to work properly. Some universal drives have brackets allowing them to be installed into various pieces of hardware, regardless of system specifications. Users should be sure they know how to install an SSD before making their purchase. Some drives come bundled with instructional DVDs and manuals that guide amateurs through the installation process step-by-step so they don't accidentally damage their system.

You can take notebooks anywhere as long as the battery is fully charged or there's an electrical outlet available to serve as a power source. Unfortunately, laptop batteries degrade over time - they store less electricity and die faster as they age. Even the best power supplies start to wear down after months of consistent use. For laptops that have a removable battery, it's easy find a replacement unit. If you know the make and model of your laptop, you can find the right battery easily. Because computers have different connection ports, it's important to find the power supply built specifically for your line of laptop. Some manufacturers offer universal batteries for notebooks that they no longer produce or support. A functioning AC adapter is another necessity for every computer, as no battery can last more than a few hours on a single charge. Like the batteries, it's important to find a compatible laptop charger for a notebook's electrical jack. Some users bring their laptops everywhere - from home to work or school and everywhere in between. Chargers can wear out from being repeatedly unplugged, and if they break there's no way to keep the notebooks they are connected to from losing power. Having a backup on hand in case of emergencies eliminates any unnecessary stress caused by waiting for a replacement. For added convenience, use one as a travel charger and leave the other at home, so you don't have to constantly unplug an adapter every time you go out.

On top of being typically faster and cheaper than laptops, an business desktop PC is easier to upgrade and usually can be repaired without being sent back to the manufacturer. With so many choices, it can be hard to find the best business desktop PC for your organization, but Newegg.com will break down what you should be looking for when shopping for a business desktop PC below. Consider the following criteria when purchasing a business desktop PC for your organization: Traditionally, a business desktop PC meant a large tower coupled with a monitor. Business desktop PCs now have towers that range from full-size to compact, with some no more than a foot tall. There are even all-in-one PCs that eliminate the tower by combining the monitor and tower into one compact unit, which can free up some space in a crowded office. A business Desktop PC that will be used for general office administration and word processing will not need huge amounts of processing power, and an octa-core processor is usually not required. Find a workable balance where the processor is powerful enough for the tasks you intend to use it for. Solid state drives are very popular, but not all business desktop PCs will need the increased read and access times that they provide. Consider getting solid state drives for business desktop PC that require fast read and write speeds for specialized jobs or fast boot speeds. Otherwise, a traditional hard drive will be sufficient for most tasks. Most business desktop PCs used for general administrative tasks and word processing will not require dedicated graphics cards, so you can reduce costs by purchasing PCs with onboard video. However, an exception may be made for business-grade graphics cards if your organization is purchasing a business desktop PC for design, simulation, rendering, or any other graphics related tasks. Also, if the tasks that the business PC will be performing require a lot of screen space, consider getting a business desktop PC with a capable of outputting video to multiple displays to improve productivity and efficiency. Many basic business desktops come with DVD writers, which should be sufficient for general use, but you can always add a Blu-ray drive if it is required for the tasks that the business PC will be doing. Keep those key points in mind when shopping for a business PC and you will find one that fulfills its role and fits your organization\u2019s budget. Avoid over-spending by buying one with specifications that are above and beyond what is needed. The ideal workstation PC should be sufficient for its function without being unnecessarily expensive and laden with necessary features.", "parent_text": "Desktop PCs", "keyword_density": {"business": "2.9", "business desktop pcs": "2.1", "pcs": "1.4", "desktop": "3.0", "business desktop": "4.4", "desktop pcs": "2.2"}, "department_id": 3},

Plasma monitors don't come in desktop sizes, and represent higher costs, weight, and energy consumption. Most homes and offices use monitors between 15 to 20 inches, though larger widescreen monitors increase productivity at work and enjoyment of games and movies at home. Newegg carries a huge variety of LCD monitors from Samsung, NEC, ViewSonic, Acer, HP, Hanns-G, ASUS, and many other major brands. Pros and Cons LCD Monitors are thin, lightweight and easy to move, and some are wall-mountable, getting them completely off your desk, providing drastically greater options for work or play. Adjustable monitor stands also offer increased ergonomics. LCD monitors have a steadier, flicker-free picture, causing far less eyestrain, and are a blessing to users who spend long hours at their screens. They use less energy than plasma monitors or CRTs. What should you consider before purchase? LCD monitors are currently available in a variety of screen sizes . A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions, which translate into more on the screen at once. LCD screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Newegg carries LCD monitors from 15\" all the way up to 52\"! Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD monitor can support. A monitor provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 5:4, similar to a standard television set's aspect ratio of 4:3. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD monitor's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD monitor's response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD monitors today can provide over 200 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Viewing angle is the greatest angle (horizontal or vertical) from which a user can view an LCD screen at an acceptable image quality. A wide viewing angle enables a group of people to view the screen at once or enables a user with greater viewing flexibility. LCD monitors are usually equipped with one or two types of connectors for connecting to your PC. D-Sub Connectors transfer analog signals and are still very popular as they are compatible with most video cards. DVI Connectors transfer a video card's digital output directly for a superior signal. The DVI connector is mainstream equipment on newer video cards and on an increasing number of new LCD monitors. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors are necessary for displays with HD resolution approaching that of HDTV, from 720-1080 lines per frame, and they're backwards-compatible with DVI systems.

That said, plenty of computer gamers are just as dedicated to the classics - if not more so - than the newest games available. Luckily, we've got classics, new favorites and everything in between. Fans of first-person shooters or similarly combat-heavy games will certainly have plenty of options on their hands. As far as genres go, these action-packed titles run the gamut from Renaissance-era swashbuckling and sci-fi dystopia to modern warfare and crime sagas. Additionally, intense role-playing games (RPGs) and real-time strategy (RTS) titles are available. Options in this category include games from established franchises like Diablo, Starcraft and Age of Empires to newer favorite series such as Fallout and The Elder Scrolls. However, those games aren't for everyone, and some are rated either T for Teen or M for Mature - intended for adults and teenagers of a certain age and maturity level. Parents, never fear - we've got plenty of other options for younger gamers and those uninterested in combat. These also encompass a wide variety of genres, as you could be creating entire new worlds in games like The Sims, planning culinary domination in Restaurant Empire or testing your wits with puzzle- and gambling-themed titles. You'll even have no trouble finding sports games or options that are suitable for even the youngest players.

To figure out what size hard drive you should buy, think about how much computing you do each day and how many files you save. If you're a heavy user, consider buying a drive with terabytes (TB) of available storage. You'll be able to save an entire system to a device with that much room, so if you need a new computer, you will be able to reinstall everything as it was previously. These units are beneficial to people who work in creative industries and have libraries that are too expansive for a single Mac external hard drive. For example, a photographer who has hundreds of thousands of pictures saved on his or her desktop won't be able to back everything up with a smaller unit. Casual consumers should consider drives with a few hundred gigabytes (GB) of space. Buying a device with TBs of data storage would result in a great deal of wasted space for users who only have a couple thousand files that need to be saved. If you plan on bringing your external Mac hard drive everywhere you go, you'll want to purchase a unit that is light and damage-resistant. Some drives are smaller than most tablets, while other devices are large enough to be confused with video game consoles. If you're prone to damaging your gadgets, consider a drive with pads and shock protectors to defend against significant bumps and bruises.

Photos, videos, and digital music have all become so popular in recent years that people need a place to put it all. CDs and DVDs do not have the capacity to hold PC backups and are not all that convenient. However, the prices of external hard drives have come down so much that they are perfect for backing up your important data. The two most common interfaces for hooking up external drives to your computer are USB and FireWire with eSata now becoming popular also. USB has been around for years and are standard on just about all computers today while FireWire ports are newer and if you use a digital video camera with your computer you probably already have one. In terms of access speeds the latest eSata standard offers the fastest connection however that comes with a price. USB 2.0 and Firewire can cover most of your general needs without having to upgrade your system with a new eSata card. Any of the interfaces will do the job however be sure to purchase an external hard drive with the same type of port that your computer has. Your backup drive should have a capacity at least as big as your computer's largest hard drive. That will leave you with plenty of room to back up your important files or mirror/clone your current drive. You can also buy an external hard drive case and mount an internal hard drive inside it. This method will give you a choice of brands and models, and if anything goes wrong with your internal hard drive, you can simply install the external one inside your computer to replace it. Considerations for External Hard Drives One drawback to using external hard drives for backups is that they are still relatively new for home computer use. They come with Windows drivers; should Windows fail, you will not be able to access your external drive through DOS. There are DOS drivers available but they can be difficult to find and most manufacturers do not provide support for them. This isn't a frequent occurrence, just something to keep in mind as you select your external hard drive.", "parent_text": "External Hard Drives", "keyword_density": {"external hard": "4.0", "external hard drives": "3.8", "hard": "3.3", "drives": "1.5", "external": "2.8"}, "department_id": 3},

If you want to use your router as a firewall also, make sure you purchase one that has a built-in firewall. Otherwise, you can purchase a firewall separately. Wireless network routers will allow you to connect computers, notebook computers, PDAs and printers without wires. They are also useful for connecting laptops to the Internet and other networks, such as at work or at home. If you want to use a wireless network router, you need to have a wireless network adapter installed in any computer that you connect to your network. If these are not already in the computers, you'll need to purchase them and add them in. To network your home computers to each other, you can use an access point instead, but we recommend routers because you can also use them for Internet sharing and firewall security. Also, home routers tend to be less expensive than access points. The Importance of Security with Wireless Network Routers Security is especially important when using a wireless network. Basically, anybody within the range of your network who has the right equipment can access it. It is very easy for them to use a network detection program to access your network. Therefore, use WEC or MAC address filtering. This is a unique hardware identifier that gives each network device its own identity. WEP, or Wireless Encryption Protocol, is another way to identify your network devices. It establishes a shared key between the access point and clients, using the key to encrypt and de-encrypt the data that is transferred between them.

Plasma monitors don't come in desktop sizes, and represent higher costs, weight, and energy consumption. Most homes and offices use monitors between 15 to 20 inches, though larger widescreen monitors increase productivity at work and enjoyment of games and movies at home. Newegg carries a huge variety of LCD monitors from Samsung, NEC, ViewSonic, Acer, HP, Hanns-G, ASUS, and many other major brands. Pros and Cons LCD Monitors are thin, lightweight and easy to move, and some are wall-mountable, getting them completely off your desk, providing drastically greater options for work or play. Adjustable monitor stands also offer increased ergonomics. LCD monitors have a steadier, flicker-free picture, causing far less eyestrain, and are a blessing to users who spend long hours at their screens. They use less energy than plasma monitors or CRTs. What should you consider before purchase? LCD monitors are currently available in a variety of screen sizes . A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions, which translate into more on the screen at once. LCD screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Newegg carries LCD monitors from 15\" all the way up to 52\"! Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD monitor can support. A monitor provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 5:4, similar to a standard television set's aspect ratio of 4:3. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD monitor's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD monitor's response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD monitors today can provide over 200 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Viewing angle is the greatest angle (horizontal or vertical) from which a user can view an LCD screen at an acceptable image quality. A wide viewing angle enables a group of people to view the screen at once or enables a user with greater viewing flexibility. LCD monitors are usually equipped with one or two types of connectors for connecting to your PC. D-Sub Connectors transfer analog signals and are still very popular as they are compatible with most video cards. DVI Connectors transfer a video card's digital output directly for a superior signal.

Plasma monitors don't come in desktop sizes, and represent higher costs, weight, and energy consumption. Most homes and offices use monitors between 15 to 20 inches, though larger widescreen monitors increase productivity at work and enjoyment of games and movies at home. Newegg carries a huge variety of LCD monitors from Samsung, NEC, ViewSonic, Acer, HP, Hanns-G, ASUS, and many other major brands. Pros and Cons LCD Monitors are thin, lightweight and easy to move, and some are wall-mountable, getting them completely off your desk, providing drastically greater options for work or play. Adjustable monitor stands also offer increased ergonomics. LCD monitors have a steadier, flicker-free picture, causing far less eyestrain, and are a blessing to users who spend long hours at their screens. They use less energy than plasma monitors or CRTs. What should you consider before purchase? LCD monitors are currently available in a variety of screen sizes . A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions, which translate into more on the screen at once. LCD screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Newegg carries LCD monitors from 15\" all the way up to 52\"! Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD monitor can support. A monitor provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 5:4, similar to a standard television set's aspect ratio of 4:3. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD monitor's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD monitor's response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD monitors today can provide over 200 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Viewing angle is the greatest angle (horizontal or vertical) from which a user can view an LCD screen at an acceptable image quality. A wide viewing angle enables a group of people to view the screen at once or enables a user with greater viewing flexibility. LCD monitors are usually equipped with one or two types of connectors for connecting to your PC. D-Sub Connectors transfer analog signals and are still very popular as they are compatible with most video cards. DVI Connectors transfer a video card's digital output directly for a superior signal. The DVI connector is mainstream equipment on newer video cards and on an increasing number of new LCD monitors. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors are necessary for displays with HD resolution approaching that of HDTV, from 780-1080 lines per inch, and they're backwards-compatible with DVI systems.", "parent_text": "Monitors", "keyword_density": {"lcd": "3.0", "monitors": "2.4", "lcd monitors": "3.5"}, "department_id": 3},

Netbooks first appeared as an answer to the mobility provided by the iPhone and enjoyed, however briefly, massive popularity. One of the closest relatives to the netbook is the Chromebook. Developed initially by Google, the Chromebook is a small laptop optimized for use with the Internet. While it may seem \"pidgeon-holed\" by its Google designation, many other manufacturers have seen promise in the device, developing their own Chromebooks and generating massive interest for a laptop in the age of tablets . How Chromebook works, what it does To be designated a Chromebook, a laptop must be running Chrome OS, which is essentially a variation of the Chrome web browser that allows for work to be done offline. Supplemented by small, fast flash storage, the cloud does most of the work for these machines. By serving more as a portal to the Internet and as less of an operating system, Chromebook users avoid constant security updates, out-of-date hardware and the sluggishness that comes with an aging system - new versions of the browser are the only system maintenance that needs to be addressed. Without a hard drive, Chromebooks experience fast boot times and enjoy extended battery life when compared to traditional laptops. Proponents of these computers praise it for its streamlined capabilities and ease of use. This sort of technology is perfect for students, and Dell 's first foray into Chromebook development was fueled by how it could be used in classrooms. Other manufacturers Google may have created it and coined its name off their own web browser, but other companies like Dell are also putting big money into the Chromebook game. Taiwanese company Acer has even developed a touchscreen unit, continuing to bridge the gap between laptops and tablets (Google has also created a touchscreen version of their Chromebook called the Pixel). Longtime computer giants HP and Samsung are some other of the notable names to also dip their toes into the market's waters. Chromebooks Affordability Chromebooks, like the netbooks that came before them, also receive admiration for their cost-effectiveness. With the notable exception of Google's new Pixel (over $1,000), most units are well under $300, making them great for productivity on a budget and ideal for students or as secondary machines to laptops that have more processing power. If all that is needed out of a laptop is some streaming, browsing, organizing and writing, and a tablet is not going to cut it, then a Chromebook may be a perfect solution.", "parent_text": "Laptops / Notebooks", "keyword_density": {"chromebook": "3.0"}, "department_id": 3},

A netbooks is a small, lightweight laptop that has been created with portability in mind. An Ultrabook improves upon the netbook by giving users a more complete computing experience. These slim pieces of machinery also come packed with high-powered features, so you don\u2019t have to sacrifice performance for portability and style. Next-generation ultrabooks To actually qualify as an Ultrabook, a PC must meet certain Intel quality standards for speed and processing power. In addition to being lightweight like its netbook predecessor, an Ultrabook must be thin. Most weigh less than three pounds and are under an inch thick when closed. Also, the high-definition resolution of an Ultrabook is superior to most monitors available today. The everlasting battery A short charge is the bane of every laptop user's existence. To combat poor performance and running time, Intel requires ultrabooks to feature at least five hours of battery life. An all-day battery would be a dream come true for most consumers. Currently, the best ultrabooks offer about eight hours of battery life, which would be particularly convenient for users who can't constantly recharge their devices. For instance, college students and traveling businesspeople won't have to worry about their laptops if Intel keeps its promise. Touchscreen may be the future Ultrabooks and tablets are strong competitors among the tech industry mainly because the devices share a great deal of similarities. Both machines are convenient for mobile use and allow users to complete basic tasks. The biggest difference between tablets and ultrabooks is their software. Tablets run on mobile operating systems like Android and iOS, while ultrabooks feature Windows 7. With Windows 8 , however, the gap between the gadgets might close completely. The next-generation of ultrabooks will look completely different from today's computers. Technological innovations and increased performance standards will force manufacturers to build high-quality laptops. If computers with all-day battery life, touchscreen capabilities and 1080p resolution become the standard, then it's difficult to imagine that there are further improvements that manufacturers could make.", "parent_text": "Laptops / Notebooks", "keyword_density": {"ultrabook": "3.3"}, "department_id": 3},

CDs and DVDs do not have the capacity to hold PC backups and are not all that convenient. However, the prices of external hard drives have come down so much that they are perfect for backing up your important data. The two most common interfaces for hooking up external drives to your computer are USB and FireWire with eSata now becoming popular also. USB has been around for years and are standard on just about all computers today while FireWire ports are newer and if you use a digital video camera with your computer you probably already have one. In terms of access speeds the latest eSata standard offers the fastest connection however that comes with a price. USB 2.0 and Firewire can cover most of your general needs without having to upgrade your system with a new eSata card. Any of the interfaces will do the job however be sure to purchase an external hard drive with the same type of port that your computer has. Your backup drive should have a capacity at least as big as your computer's largest hard drive. That will leave you with plenty of room to back up your important files or mirror/clone your current drive. You can also buy an external hard drive case and mount an internal hard drive inside it. This method will give you a choice of brands and models, and if anything goes wrong with your internal hard drive, you can simply install the external one inside your computer to replace it. Considerations for External Hard Drives One drawback to using external hard drives for backups is that they are still relatively new for home computer use. They come with Windows drivers; should Windows fail, you will not be able to access your external drive through DOS. There are DOS drivers available but they can be difficult to find and most manufacturers do not provide support for them.

All the equipment needs to be compatible to give an audience the best viewing experience. Due to strides in technology, audio devices can make movies and television shows sound crystal clear, but a standard high-definition television's picture might lag behind a sound system's performance. Buying the best home theater projector could level the playing field. If you're going to be watching a great deal of programming, a projector might be easier on the eyes than an LCD or LED television. The devices are backlit to create a sharper image on screen, while sending light directly into your vision. This is what usually causes eye strain after watching for an extended period of time. Projectors are only directing light toward the screen, making it more comfortable to enjoy a movie marathon. There is more flexibility with a home theater projector, as well. Instead of having a television with a set size, a projector can be adjusted to fill bigger and smaller display areas. Moving the device further away from the screen creates a bigger image, while moving it closer shrinks it. This is a convenient adjustment for users who want to use their device in more than one room. It is important to note the minimum and maximum size settings on each projector, because picture quality will deteriorate if moved beyond those thresholds. You may want to consider the lamp life of a projector before making a purchase. Light bulbs don't last forever, so at some point you'll need to replace one in your device. Most projectors offer settings designed to lengthen a bulb's life, but these options may reduce viewing quality while cutting down on power consumption. It's important to consider all your needs before buying a home theater projector. Make sure you have figured out what you expect from the device and what you'll use it for, so you can buy the best one for your home theater.", "parent_text": "Projectors", "keyword_density": {"home theater": "3.0", "projectors": "0.6"}, "department_id": 3},

Photos, videos, and digital music have all become so popular in recent years that people need a place to put it all. CDs and DVDs do not have the capacity to hold PC backups and are not all that convenient. However, the prices of external hard drives have come down so much that they are perfect for backing up your important data. The two most common interfaces for hooking up external drives to your computer are USB and FireWire with eSata now becoming popular also. USB has been around for years and are standard on just about all computers today while FireWire ports are newer and if you use a digital video camera with your computer you probably already have one. In terms of access speeds the latest eSata standard offers the fastest connection however that comes with a price. USB 2.0 and Firewire can cover most of your general needs without having to upgrade your system with a new eSata card. Any of the interfaces will do the job however be sure to purchase an external hard drive with the same type of port that your computer has. Your backup drive should have a capacity at least as big as your computer's largest hard drive. That will leave you with plenty of room to back up your important files or mirror/clone your current drive. You can also buy an external hard drive case and mount an internal hard drive inside it. This method will give you a choice of brands and models, and if anything goes wrong with your internal hard drive, you can simply install the external one inside your computer to replace it. Considerations for External Hard Drives One drawback to using external hard drives for backups is that they are still relatively new for home computer use. They come with Windows drivers; should Windows fail, you will not be able to access your external drive through DOS. There are DOS drivers available but they can be difficult to find and most manufacturers do not provide support for them. This isn't a frequent occurrence, just something to keep in mind as you select your external hard drive.", "parent_text": "Ultrabooks", "keyword_density": {"external hard": "4.0", "external hard drives": "3.8", "hard": "3.3", "drives": "1.5", "external": "2.8"}, "department_id": 3},

Other models offer ethernet connections, USB ports and audio jacks but lack a disc reader. You can pick and choose which features you need to supplement your laptop's functionality. Port replicators can be quickly disconnected so a device is never tethered to a desk. Users can connect all peripheral devices, like external hard drives and printers, to a base so instead of unplugging multiple accessories only the docking station needs to be removed from a tablet or laptop.

Most people use their computers as gateways to the internet, so it can be frustrating if they can't go online because they can't find an ethernet cable. Consumers can buy wireless cards for laptops so their devices can connect with a signal from anywhere. These cards need to be installed to a computer's motherboard to use a wireless signal. Many of the available models come with tutorials and instruction guides, so even shoppers who aren't tech-savvy can easily install their new purchase. Laptop wireless cards act as internal receivers, allowing a computer to connect to the internet over the air without an ethernet cord. Users who are on the go need this added convenience so their devices can be fully functional anywhere there's a wireless signal. For example, college students can install a card so their laptops work in class and in the library - not just in their dorm rooms or apartments. A laptop must be within a certain proximity to a Wi-Fi router to receive the signal, as the card itself does not generate web connectivity. Fortunately, many establishments, ranging from coffee shops to public libraries, provide wireless web access, so everyone can find a place to go online. For users who want to add an ethernet connection to their notebook, there are cards with jacks for cords. Manufacturers have begun producing slim laptops that remove ethernet ports to reduce the devices' overall weight. Much like a wireless card, these units are installed internally but have an external attachment intended for a wired connection. You should make sure the wireless card you're thinking about purchasing matches your computer's hardware specifications.

Consider a laptop briefcase or over-the-shoulder messenger case. Our professional models are both rugged and stylish.

Backpack laptop cases are easy to carry around campus, and many models offer lifetime warranties, so you know they\u2019ll be able to keep up with your busy lifestyle.

This process requires a great deal of electricity to function properly, which can cause a delay in the speed with which information is displayed on-screen. Solid state drives (SSDs) are becoming a popular alternative to the factory-installed drives. SSDs resemble HDDs on the outside, but their internal processes don't have much in common. The newer drives don't have any moving parts - unlike hard drives that have two magnetic, spinning plates. There are two key advantages to this structural design - it requires less power and provides faster access to saved data. Because files can be read straight from the SSDs, laptops are able to boot up without delay. Users have individual storage needs, so some might not find one SSD as useful as others. There are some drives with only 32 gigabytes (GB) of space, which may be enough for casual use but not enough to save large libraries or backup entire systems. Luckily, there are SSD deals available for every size unit from various manufacturers. This makes it simple to find the correct piece of equipment for every PC, as the two devices must be compatible to work properly. Some universal drives have brackets allowing them to be installed into various pieces of hardware, regardless of system specifications. Users should be sure they know how to install an SSD before making their purchase.

This process requires a great deal of electricity to function properly, which can cause a delay in the speed with which information is displayed on-screen. Solid state drives (SSDs) are becoming a popular alternative to the factory-installed drives. SSDs resemble HDDs on the outside, but their internal processes don't have much in common. The newer drives don't have any moving parts - unlike hard drives that have two magnetic, spinning plates. There are two key advantages to this structural design - it requires less power and provides faster access to saved data. Because files can be read straight from the SSDs, laptops are able to boot up without delay. Users have individual storage needs, so some might not find one SSD as useful as others. There are some drives with only 32 gigabytes (GB) of space, which may be enough for casual use but not enough to save large libraries or backup entire systems. Luckily, there are SSD deals available for every size unit from various manufacturers. This makes it simple to find the correct piece of equipment for every PC, as the two devices must be compatible to work properly. Some universal drives have brackets allowing them to be installed into various pieces of hardware, regardless of system specifications. Users should be sure they know how to install an SSD before making their purchase. Some drives come bundled with instructional DVDs and manuals that guide amateurs through the installation process step-by-step so they don't accidentally damage their system.

Most people use their computers as gateways to the internet, so it can be frustrating if they can't go online because they can't find an ethernet cable. Consumers can buy wireless cards for laptops so their devices can connect with a signal from anywhere. These cards need to be installed to a computer's motherboard to use a wireless signal. Many of the available models come with tutorials and instruction guides, so even shoppers who aren't tech-savvy can easily install their new purchase. Laptop wireless cards act as internal receivers, allowing a computer to connect to the internet over the air without an ethernet cord. Users who are on the go need this added convenience so their devices can be fully functional anywhere there's a wireless signal. For example, college students can install a card so their laptops work in class and in the library - not just in their dorm rooms or apartments. A laptop must be within a certain proximity to a Wi-Fi router to receive the signal, as the card itself does not generate web connectivity. Fortunately, many establishments, ranging from coffee shops to public libraries, provide wireless web access, so everyone can find a place to go online. For users who want to add an ethernet connection to their notebook, there are cards with jacks for cords. Manufacturers have begun producing slim laptops that remove ethernet ports to reduce the devices' overall weight. Much like a wireless card, these units are installed internally but have an external attachment intended for a wired connection. You should make sure the wireless card you're thinking about purchasing matches your computer's hardware specifications. Access points must have driver support to function properly, so be sure to check what your system is capable of supporting.", "parent_text": "Laptop Accessories", "keyword_density": {"wireless": "2.2", "cards": "1.3", "laptop": "1.9", "wireless cards": "1.3", "laptop wireless cards": "1.0"}, "department_id": 3},

Buying the best home theater projector could level the playing field. If you're going to be watching a great deal of programming, a projector might be easier on the eyes than an LCD or LED television. The devices are backlit to create a sharper image on screen, while sending light directly into your vision. This is what usually causes eye strain after watching for an extended period of time. Projectors are only directing light toward the screen, making it more comfortable to enjoy a movie marathon. There is more flexibility with a home theater projector, as well. Instead of having a television with a set size, a projector can be adjusted to fill bigger and smaller display areas. Moving the device further away from the screen creates a bigger image, while moving it closer shrinks it. This is a convenient adjustment for users who want to use their device in more than one room. It is important to note the minimum and maximum size settings on each projector, because picture quality will deteriorate if moved beyond those thresholds. You may want to consider the lamp life of a projector before making a purchase. Light bulbs don't last forever, so at some point you'll need to replace one in your device. Most projectors offer settings designed to lengthen a bulb's life, but these options may reduce viewing quality while cutting down on power consumption. It's important to consider all your needs before buying a home theater projector.

Port replicators connect to a laptop or tablet via the battery hook-up, so the peripheral acts as a base for the device. Some tablet stations include an external keyboard for consumers who don't like typing on the screen, while others may need extra USB slots to connect with other accessories.

Most people use their computers as gateways to the internet, so it can be frustrating if they can't go online because they can't find an ethernet cable. Consumers can buy wireless cards for laptops so their devices can connect with a signal from anywhere. These cards need to be installed to a computer's motherboard to use a wireless signal. Many of the available models come with tutorials and instruction guides, so even shoppers who aren't tech-savvy can easily install their new purchase. Laptop wireless cards act as internal receivers, allowing a computer to connect to the internet over the air without an ethernet cord. Users who are on the go need this added convenience so their devices can be fully functional anywhere there's a wireless signal. For example, college students can install a card so their laptops work in class and in the library - not just in their dorm rooms or apartments. A laptop must be within a certain proximity to a Wi-Fi router to receive the signal, as the card itself does not generate web connectivity. Fortunately, many establishments, ranging from coffee shops to public libraries, provide wireless web access, so everyone can find a place to go online. For users who want to add an ethernet connection to their notebook, there are cards with jacks for cords. Manufacturers have begun producing slim laptops that remove ethernet ports to reduce the devices' overall weight. Much like a wireless card, these units are installed internally but have an external attachment intended for a wired connection.

Backpack laptop cases are easy to carry around campus, and many models offer lifetime warranties, so you know they\u2019ll be able to keep up with your busy lifestyle.

For laptops that have a removable battery, it's easy find a replacement unit. If you know the make and model of your laptop, you can find the right battery easily. Because computers have different connection ports, it's important to find the power supply built specifically for your line of laptop.

Like the batteries, it's important to find a compatible laptop charger for a notebook's electrical jack. Some users bring their laptops everywhere - from home to work or school and everywhere in between. Chargers can wear out from being repeatedly unplugged, and if they break there's no way to keep the notebooks they are connected to from losing power. Having a backup on hand in case of emergencies eliminates any unnecessary stress caused by waiting for a replacement. For added convenience, use one as a travel charger and leave the other at home, so you don't have to constantly unplug an adapter every time you go out.

Most people use their computers as gateways to the internet, so it can be frustrating if they can't go online because they can't find an ethernet cable. Consumers can buy wireless cards for laptops so their devices can connect with a signal from anywhere. These cards need to be installed to a computer's motherboard to use a wireless signal. Many of the available models come with tutorials and instruction guides, so even shoppers who aren't tech-savvy can easily install their new purchase. Laptop wireless cards act as internal receivers, allowing a computer to connect to the internet over the air without an ethernet cord. Users who are on the go need this added convenience so their devices can be fully functional anywhere there's a wireless signal. For example, college students can install a card so their laptops work in class and in the library - not just in their dorm rooms or apartments. A laptop must be within a certain proximity to a Wi-Fi router to receive the signal, as the card itself does not generate web connectivity. Fortunately, many establishments, ranging from coffee shops to public libraries, provide wireless web access, so everyone can find a place to go online. For users who want to add an ethernet connection to their notebook, there are cards with jacks for cords. Manufacturers have begun producing slim laptops that remove ethernet ports to reduce the devices' overall weight. Much like a wireless card, these units are installed internally but have an external attachment intended for a wired connection. You should make sure the wireless card you're thinking about purchasing matches your computer's hardware specifications. Access points must have driver support to function properly, so be sure to check what your system is capable of supporting.", "parent_text": "Laptop Accessories", "keyword_density": {"wireless": "2.2", "cards": "1.3", "laptop": "1.9", "wireless cards": "1.3", "laptop wireless cards": "1.0"}, "department_id": 3},

At Newegg you\u2019ll find affordable, stylish options perfect for any professional. Need a way to tote your work while still looking sharp? Consider a laptop briefcase or over-the-shoulder messenger case. Our professional models are both rugged and stylish.

The units hold data and spin when users access their content. This process requires a great deal of electricity to function properly, which can cause a delay in the speed with which information is displayed on-screen. Solid state drives (SSDs) are becoming a popular alternative to the factory-installed drives. SSDs resemble HDDs on the outside, but their internal processes don't have much in common. The newer drives don't have any moving parts - unlike hard drives that have two magnetic, spinning plates. There are two key advantages to this structural design - it requires less power and provides faster access to saved data. Because files can be read straight from the SSDs, laptops are able to boot up without delay. Users have individual storage needs, so some might not find one SSD as useful as others. There are some drives with only 32 gigabytes (GB) of space, which may be enough for casual use but not enough to save large libraries or backup entire systems. Luckily, there are SSD deals available for every size unit from various manufacturers. This makes it simple to find the correct piece of equipment for every PC, as the two devices must be compatible to work properly. Some universal drives have brackets allowing them to be installed into various pieces of hardware, regardless of system specifications. Users should be sure they know how to install an SSD before making their purchase. Some drives come bundled with instructional DVDs and manuals that guide amateurs through the installation process step-by-step so they don't accidentally damage their system.

You can take notebooks anywhere as long as the battery is fully charged or there's an electrical outlet available to serve as a power source. Unfortunately, laptop batteries degrade over time - they store less electricity and die faster as they age. Even the best power supplies start to wear down after months of consistent use. For laptops that have a removable battery, it's easy find a replacement unit. If you know the make and model of your laptop, you can find the right battery easily. Because computers have different connection ports, it's important to find the power supply built specifically for your line of laptop. Some manufacturers offer universal batteries for notebooks that they no longer produce or support. A functioning AC adapter is another necessity for every computer, as no battery can last more than a few hours on a single charge. Like the batteries, it's important to find a compatible laptop charger for a notebook's electrical jack. Some users bring their laptops everywhere - from home to work or school and everywhere in between. Chargers can wear out from being repeatedly unplugged, and if they break there's no way to keep the notebooks they are connected to from losing power. Having a backup on hand in case of emergencies eliminates any unnecessary stress caused by waiting for a replacement. For added convenience, use one as a travel charger and leave the other at home, so you don't have to constantly unplug an adapter every time you go out. Until computer companies invent and produce everlasting batteries, it's important to have the necessary electrical equipment for a laptop. Without the right battery or charger, no computer will be functional after a single day of use.", "parent_text": "Laptop Accessories", "keyword_density": {"chargers": "0.3", "laptop": "2.6", "batteries": "1.3", "laptop batteries": "0.6"}, "department_id": 3},

As the advent of Ivy Bridge revolutionizes the computing power of ultra-slim devices , the best tablets are able to process more than some laptops at this point without having to tote around bulky or heavy tools. The largest tablets are about 10 inches across - similar in size to a netbook - yet lacking the external keyboard or hinged shell. Some of these have front-facing as well as rear-facing cameras, meaning you can chat online or take pictures and video with a larger mobile device, and then simply upload the content straight to the internet. Peripherals for tablets are as smart, sleek and small as the devices they're designed to support.

All the equipment needs to be compatible to give an audience the best viewing experience. Due to strides in technology, audio devices can make movies and television shows sound crystal clear, but a standard high-definition television's picture might lag behind a sound system's performance. Buying the best home theater projector could level the playing field. If you're going to be watching a great deal of programming, a projector might be easier on the eyes than an LCD or LED television. The devices are backlit to create a sharper image on screen, while sending light directly into your vision. This is what usually causes eye strain after watching for an extended period of time. Projectors are only directing light toward the screen, making it more comfortable to enjoy a movie marathon. There is more flexibility with a home theater projector, as well. Instead of having a television with a set size, a projector can be adjusted to fill bigger and smaller display areas. Moving the device further away from the screen creates a bigger image, while moving it closer shrinks it. This is a convenient adjustment for users who want to use their device in more than one room. It is important to note the minimum and maximum size settings on each projector, because picture quality will deteriorate if moved beyond those thresholds. You may want to consider the lamp life of a projector before making a purchase. Light bulbs don't last forever, so at some point you'll need to replace one in your device. Most projectors offer settings designed to lengthen a bulb's life, but these options may reduce viewing quality while cutting down on power consumption. It's important to consider all your needs before buying a home theater projector. Make sure you have figured out what you expect from the device and what you'll use it for, so you can buy the best one for your home theater.", "parent_text": "Projectors", "keyword_density": {"home theater": "3.0", "projectors": "0.6"}, "department_id": 3},

Photos, videos, and digital music have all become so popular in recent years that people need a place to put it all. CDs and DVDs do not have the capacity to hold PC backups and are not all that convenient. However, the prices of external hard drives have come down so much that they are perfect for backing up your important data. The two most common interfaces for hooking up external drives to your computer are USB and FireWire with eSata now becoming popular also. USB has been around for years and are standard on just about all computers today while FireWire ports are newer and if you use a digital video camera with your computer you probably already have one. In terms of access speeds the latest eSata standard offers the fastest connection however that comes with a price. USB 2.0 and Firewire can cover most of your general needs without having to upgrade your system with a new eSata card. Any of the interfaces will do the job however be sure to purchase an external hard drive with the same type of port that your computer has. Your backup drive should have a capacity at least as big as your computer's largest hard drive. That will leave you with plenty of room to back up your important files or mirror/clone your current drive. You can also buy an external hard drive case and mount an internal hard drive inside it. This method will give you a choice of brands and models, and if anything goes wrong with your internal hard drive, you can simply install the external one inside your computer to replace it. Considerations for External Hard Drives One drawback to using external hard drives for backups is that they are still relatively new for home computer use. They come with Windows drivers; should Windows fail, you will not be able to access your external drive through DOS. There are DOS drivers available but they can be difficult to find and most manufacturers do not provide support for them. This isn't a frequent occurrence, just something to keep in mind as you select your external hard drive.", "parent_text": "External Hard Drives", "keyword_density": {"external hard": "4.0", "external hard drives": "3.8", "hard": "3.3", "drives": "1.5", "external": "2.8"}, "department_id": 3},

Understanding Video Card Specifications The video card processes all graphics related work (especially 3D) and delivers the resultant output to a connected display/monitor. Video card improvements move along at breakneck speeds - a new generation of video cards often replaces the old within 3-6 months. The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) basically determines the features (e.g. DirectX/OpenGL, HDR, and SLI or CrossFire) and performance level of a video card. Besides the GPU, the video memory specs (including video memory type, size and clock speed), interface (AGP or PCI Express), and I/O ports are should all be taken into account before purchasing a video card.", "parent_text": "Video Cards & Video Devices", "keyword_density": {"video cards": "2.3", "video": "6.2"}, "department_id": 1},

If you're looking for flexibility, portability and quality, chances are you're going to want to get a cordless phone. Cordless phones can be set up in any room of the house, and the independent handset can be carried from one room to the next. Depending on the signal strength of the charging stand, you can even take it to a different floor or outside the house without worrying about dropping the call. Unlike with a cell phone or bluetooth device, this can make a cordless phone a more desirable option when you're making calls from home. Furthermore, by ditching the cords and removing the physical tether, you've got the freedom to roam while you talk so you can get things done and not be forced to stay in one place or cut short a conversation. A cordless phone can also have a number of other receivers set up throughout the house. This means that multiple handsets and charging bases can be married to a single main dock - but you can charge them on any available unit. Additionally, you'll never have to worry about running through the house searching for a receiver again - you can sync three or more cordless phone cradles in various rooms of the house and have easy access for incoming or outgoing calls. Finally, because cordless phones use rechargeable batteries in their handsets, you can carry one with you while the others charge so you've always got a reliable phone line at the ready.", "parent_text": "Telephones / VoIP", "keyword_density": {"cordless phones": "1.5", "cordless": "2.2"}, "department_id": 4},

You have a half-dozen computers working together, sending and receiving documents, collaborating on projects, communicating quickly and easily without the interference and lag of a general connection, and you're confident that your network is running properly. Then, you realize that you have to print something. Getting printers set up and accessible within a network structure can be frustrating, especially when working with remote servers and accessing machines, but print servers can assist with getting these devices working more quickly. Whether wired or wireless, these devices plug in to printer network connection ports, granting usage for authorized users and those within the system. As not every manufacturer makes printers compatible with every kind of network or every other print device on the market, a print server can override this incompatibility, making a device usable as long as it has the right adapter. It's also great for offices with multiple printers. A network can host so many machines that it's cumbersome to have all print jobs routed to the same printer, especially when a device is built to handle multiple functions. A printer can also be a scanner, copier and fax machine, making it necessary to have more than one machine to fit unit-task needs, so routing them all into a single client can make it easy for users in a vast network to select a device that's not busy. This also helps when one of these printers inevitably gets jammed. Print servers hook devices into a network in a way that makes them most useful to the greatest number of users. These devices are affordable and easy to install, increase the productivity and flexibility of those working with them and can help make an office a much saner place to work.", "parent_text": "Office Equipment", "keyword_density": {"printer": "2.2", "servers": "0.9"}, "department_id": 4},

Writing them down on the go can be troublesome, especially if you are in a moving vehicle. Voice recorders are the perfect way to record your brilliant ideas without the need for cassette tapes or writing instruments. You can record memos, business meetings, an audio journal, and your phone conversations with these. Instead of storing the information on tape, the machines store them in digital formats. You can then transfer them to your computer to play them back or archive them, or send the audio files to other people through email. If you only need occasional voice recordings or basic functionality, a PDA or MP3 player with voice recording capability will probably suit your needs. However, if you're someone who needs to record conversations, you're better off with a dedicated digital voice recorder. Browse our site to find a large selection and the lowest prices on digital voice recording devices. While smartphones can do almost everything, their generalized functionality prevents the devices from excelling at some tasks. In addition, they have limited storage, and media files like recordings require large amounts of space. Content can easily be lost amid all of the documents stored on such devices, meaning that valuable information could be all but inaccessible. Additionally, some recorders have over 4GB of memory, meaning they can hold sizable libraries. Digital voice recorders only store audio files and can easily be connected to computers to export all documents. Some of these devices are equipped with built-in USB drives allowing you to easily save your notes once you're done recording. These specific models don't require wires, so they're more convenient to use while on the go. Sometimes you'll need to listen to something immediately, so reliable playback is a necessity. There are recorders with speakers and headphone jacks so you can listen to everything instantly without allowing anyone else to hear. Recorders feature strong battery life, so you never have to worry about them dying at an inopportune time. For instance, if you're recording a lecture, you shouldn't worry that you'll miss the conclusion because of a dead battery. Some audiophiles quickly notice the poor quality, especially in digital devices, and prefer analog gadgets. As an alternative, cassette recorders are also available. Some may argue that tapes are inefficient because they don't have large storage capacities, though tapes can be recycled so you don't have to frequently buy new ones.

Features and Applications of Our Fax Machines Scanning and printing capabilities are two of the most important aspects of any fax machine, photo copier, or printer. If you prefer to have the capability to send and receive color documents, there are plenty of color fax machines in our online catalog. Surprisingly, color fax machines are not much more expensive than black-and-white-only machines. Modem speed is probably the most important thing you will look for in a fax machine. The slower the speed the lower the amount of pages you can transmit in a minute. Most fax machines today are in the 14.4Kbps or 33.6Kbs ranges and perform quite quick with transmission speeds between 6 seconds (slower models) and 2 seconds (faster models) per page.

It's inefficient for employees to manually enter every Universal Product Code (UPC). If customers have large purchase orders, it may take awhile for those transactions to be completed. Barcode scanners can simplify the entire process and save time during checkouts. These devices read barcodes and enter the product information directly to your registers. Employees simply wave the readers over items to check the prices. Every POS terminal is different and there are various scanner models for every system. USB barcode scanners can be used with almost every register. As long you have an available USB port you can sync the reader to your system and start ringing items. Employees shouldn't struggle with their hardware. Small problems can cause delays that frustrate customers who are tired of waiting. If a scanner's cord is tangled, associates have to stop helping patrons and untie the knots. Wireless barcode scanners are easy to use and don't require any additional steps to sync with POS terminals. Scanners have many advantages over entering prices or UPCs for every purchase. For example, if your employees manually enter item totals, there's no way to track inventory. Barcode scanners can help connect your registers to your stockroom so you can monitor which products are selling quickly and should be restocked soon. Barcode readers also help employees complete more transactions. Associates only need to press a button to scan an item through. Additionally, workers can interact with patrons and deliver stronger customer service because staffers don't have to read long codes and type them repeatedly.", "parent_text": "Office Equipment", "keyword_density": {"barcode scanners": "2.8", "barcode": "2.1", "scanners": "1.7"}, "department_id": 4},

Android tablets are consumer favorites because the software is very similar to the programs used on most smartphones. Users can add apps, games and features with only a couple of taps and gestures. Many people enjoy the familiarity and intuitive-nature of Android. You should always consider your options and find the device that is most suited for your needs. Windows 8 tablets are relatively new, but the devices combine popular features from Microsoft's operating system series with a mobile operating system. The tiled interface bears similarities to the Windows Phone, but it is more customizable and has a wider range of apps. Once you pick the perfect tablet, you'll need the right accessories. Detachable keyboards are a necessity if you want your mobile device to replace your laptop for all of your computing needs. The peripherals are very important if you buy a Windows 8 tablet so you can easily type in programs like Microsoft Word and Excel. Screen covers are among the most important tablet accessories. Tablets have large displays that are susceptible to scratches and scuff marks. You can either buy a plastic cover that blocks out dust or a protective sleeve that also saves prevents the bezel from damage.

We've made it a priority to carry home theater systems at prices that anyone can appreciate. Take a look at a few examples, which run the gamut from incredibly affordable systems to the most high-quality models. The primary draw, for many of those looking to acquire a home theater system, is the surround sound - hearing and feeling the strains of the musical score, sound effects and dialogue swirl around you and transport you to another place. A system worth its salt, so to speak, should have four satellite speakers, a center channel and a powerful subwoofer, to experience the loudest bass booms and the quietest dialogue in crystal clarity. Many systems at various price tiers feature that exact speaker layout. Those looking for a set-up that's a little bit simpler and involves less chance of cables becoming confusingly intertwined can find systems with wireless speakers. While no sound system can be truly \"wireless,\" some feature two or more speakers that use an infra-red connection and help you cut down on clutter. Despite all that talk about sound, the image is - of course - just as important. Your primary choice will be between a home theater with a Blu-ray or DVD player. The former can play films on either format, and obviously provides high sound and picture quality in resolution as high as 1080p. A system featuring the latter, meanwhile, will be significantly cheaper in almost all instances. That said, Blu-ray is becoming a more common format in today's market, and as such it's more affordable for the average consumer than ever before. Take a close look and you'll be sure to find a home theater system that meets your needs and doesn't make you break the bank.", "parent_text": "Electronics", "keyword_density": {"home theater systems": "0.9", "home theater": "3.1", "systems": "1.2"}, "department_id": 4},

Without a good or at least serviceable sound system, audio content can be distorted and quality can be affected by feedback. Poor playback is especially noticeable while driving, as auto manufacturers don't typically install high-end car speakers. However, drivers can always seek out and install their own devices. The two most important features to look for when buying car speakers are sensitivity and power limits. Sensitivity refers to the sound your speakers produce based on the electricity they receive. Speakers with high sensitivity work best with radios with lower power levels and vice versa. Speakers can produce fuller sounds if they have more features. For instance, a 3-way model has one more driver than a 2-way device, meaning that mid-range sounds are louder. When listening to music, you'll clearly hear background instruments. There are even 4-way speakers that can produce much richer tones than their counterparts. Devices are available in every size and with various settings. You can find the best make and model for your vehicle, so you don't have to return your speakers due to incompatibility. Installing speakers is impossible if you don't have the correct components. Fortunately, there are bundles available that include all the necessary cables so you can easily connect your new speakers with your audio system. These packages are beneficial to budget-conscious drivers who don't want to hire professionals for the relatively simple task. Few people sit in silence on the road. Music is a necessity for most drivers, especially those who like to sing along to their favorite songs while they're in traffic or barreling down empty streets. Speakers play an important part in audio production, so if you want to hear every note clearly you should consider installing new ones in your vehicle.

This makes it ideal for devices such as digital cameras where batteries go dead often. With being able to retain data even when power is lost you can rest assured that all your pictures will still be kept safe on the memory card. Examples of flash memory cards include Secure Digital (SD) memory cards, Compact Flash (CF) memory cards, and Sony's Memory Sticks (MS, M2, MS Duo, MS Pro, and MS Pro Duo) to name a few. Other examples of proprietary and permanent flash memory devices include memory cards for video gaming systems. The Benefits of Flash Memory Flash memory is extremely small, fast, lightweight, and makes no noise or have any moving parts, unlike hard drives. However, hard disks can hold considerably more data and its cost per megabyte is much cheaper although prices are quickly dropping as capacity grows larger for flash devices daily. Yet flash memory is quite reliable and allows you to specify which data you want to keep. USB flash drives are known as the floppy disks of the 21st century. You can see people walking around with them dangling from key chains, backpacks, and even around their necks. These are more resistant to physical abuse than the media cards used in digital cameras. They're also an improvement over optical storage like CDs and DVDs, which are easily scratched. Prices of the drives have come down so much that many companies give them to clients instead of printing reports and wasting paper and ink. In some schools, students are required to have them. At Newegg, we stock a wide variety of flash memory. Browse our site to find the lowest prices on the flash memory you want.", "parent_text": "Digital Cameras", "keyword_density": {"flash memory": "5.6", "flash": "3.7", "memory": "4.3"}, "department_id": 4},

Mono Bluetooth headsets clip over one ear and are useful for walking around in public or taking a call in the car where there are plenty of other things that require your attention. Keeping one ear open will alert you to other conversations or potential situations in your immediate area that require a response and Bluetooth headsets let you do just that without taking away the use of one of your hands. Also, seeing as many U.S. states have laws restricting phone use - including texting and phone calls - while driving, Bluetooth headsets will keep you in touch with friends and co-workers without the risk of getting a ticket or putting other motorists in danger. A stereo Bluetooth headset covers both ears and is useful for playing video games or listening to music. You can go out for a walk or to the gym with your iPod or MP3 player, and not worry about getting a headphone cord tangled on yourself or the workout equipment. You'll be able to get up from your computer and get a drink without taking off your headphones or missing out on a minute of in-game or online chatter.

Our digital cameras cover all prices and levels of sophistication. Because there are major differences between these cameras, we offer you a detailed listing of specifications for all our cameras. Understanding the Specifications of Digital Cameras First of all, count your pixels! The most important number to be considered when buying a digital camera is the number of pixels or megapixels it captures. Pixels translate into resolution, and a high resolution results in clear, crisp, and detailed photographs. Most magazines require an image to print with a minimum print resolution of 300ppi (pixels per inch) for publication. To get that kind of resolution for four- by six-inch prints, you\u00a1\u00afre going to want at least a four-megapixel camera. If you plan on blowing pictures up to eight by ten inches, on the other hand, you\u00a1\u00afre looking for at least 8 megapixels, and if you enter the rarified rangers above that, you have a professional-grade camera. Newegg carries cameras with up to 16 megapixels! For the highest quality digital photographs, get a camera that has at least 3X optical zoom. The less expensive cameras have digital zoom, but that zoom is restricted by the camera\u00a1\u00afs resolution, and higher digital zoom images may appear blurry or pixilated. Here at Newegg, our most sophisticated digital cameras have 12X optical zoom. Shutter speeds are the other major factor to be considered when selecting a digital camera. The slower the shutter, the blurrier your pictures could be. If the shutter speed is 1/30, using a tripod is a must. When shutter speed is upwards of 1/125, you can take clear pictures of moving cars and trucks. In addition to the above specifications, you should also consider memory storage, battery life, the type of batteries the camera takes, and whether or not the camera is compatible with photo editing software. Many of the newer cameras support automated shooting modes which adjust the settings for you based on commonly-used situations. That, plus other features such as automatic image stabilization, which uses computer memory to refine an image in motion, can help you get the most satisfaction for your dollar.", "parent_text": "Digital Cameras", "keyword_density": {"digital cameras": "2.5", "cameras": "2.5", "digital": "2.5"}, "department_id": 4},

Every picture should be clear and focused, but this may be difficult to do consistently if the camera is held in hand. Instead of thinking only about a photo's subject, photographers must make sure their hands are steady and have the correct angle for the shot. A camera tripod reduces those concerns, so these artists only have to think about what pictures to take. A tripod is a steady base for a camera that holds the device in a mounted, fixed position. Even the slightest movement on the photographer's part can cause an image to be blurry or out of focus. A camera stand eliminates the need for reshoots by eliminating much of the risk of human error. There are different tripods available depending on the chosen medium. Photographers mostly deal with still images, so it might be best to buy a stand with a static camera base to focus on one subject during a shot. For videographers who need to follow action while recording, a tripod with an adjustable head allows for easier panning. You should make sure all your equipment is safe during transport and easy to carry, as well. A bag can protect your new stand and some of your other equipment. Some carrying cases include extra padding and rigid outer shells to protect your camera from any accidents - like falling onto concrete or landing in water. Other bags are designed with a tripod in mind, so you can sling it over your shoulder and still have your hands free to take pictures while on the go. Whether you're a professional photographer or a hobbyist, it's important to make sure you're capturing an image as the eye sees it.", "parent_text": "Digital Cameras", "keyword_density": {"camera": "2.3", "tripods": "0.3"}, "department_id": 4},

Digital single lens reflex (DSLR) cameras, such as the Canon EOS 5d Mark II , give automatic feedback and allow you to review the work you've just shot so you can determine if you need to adjust shutter speed, brightness or aperture size, giving you more control over your process and product. These devices are powerful, flexible and can be upgraded without having to continually purchase new technology, unlike a standard digital camera that might age out of modernity much more quickly. These are built much like a traditional SLR camera but with digital storage and a screen like a standard digital that shows what you've shot. This helps you make adjustments, change the subject or fine tune other aspects within the frame to get the best image possible. The other nice addition is storage capacity. Unlike an SLR requiring rolls and rolls of film that's costly to develop, these cameras take memory cards with gigabytes of storage space. You don't need to switch out rolls or pay to develop them, and you don't need to worry about running out of space in the middle of a shoot. Like a standard SLR camera, there are lenses and flash devices that can be attached to the body of the device to extend zoom and give better shots in difficult weather conditions, such as rain or night shoots. These tools are also equipped with CMOS or live MOS, tools that help deliver better image quality through light absorption without over-straining battery cells. Regardless of which you choose in your camera, it would be wise to buy either a backup rechargeable battery pack or a package of standard rechargeable batteries in order to get the most out of your DSLR camera.", "parent_text": "Digital Cameras", "keyword_density": {"cameras": "0.6", "dslr": "0.6", "dslr cameras": "0.6"}, "department_id": 4},

This makes it ideal for devices such as digital cameras where batteries go dead often. With being able to retain data even when power is lost you can rest assured that all your pictures will still be kept safe on the memory card. Examples of flash memory cards include Secure Digital (SD) memory cards, Compact Flash (CF) memory cards, and Sony's Memory Sticks (MS, M2, MS Duo, MS Pro, and MS Pro Duo) to name a few. Other examples of proprietary and permanent flash memory devices include memory cards for video gaming systems. The Benefits of Flash Memory Flash memory is extremely small, fast, lightweight, and makes no noise or have any moving parts, unlike hard drives. However, hard disks can hold considerably more data and its cost per megabyte is much cheaper although prices are quickly dropping as capacity grows larger for flash devices daily. Yet flash memory is quite reliable and allows you to specify which data you want to keep. USB flash drives are known as the floppy disks of the 21st century. You can see people walking around with them dangling from key chains, backpacks, and even around their necks. These are more resistant to physical abuse than the media cards used in digital cameras. They're also an improvement over optical storage like CDs and DVDs, which are easily scratched. Prices of the drives have come down so much that many companies give them to clients instead of printing reports and wasting paper and ink. In some schools, students are required to have them. At Newegg, we stock a wide variety of flash memory.

Our digital cameras cover all prices and levels of sophistication. We offer you a detailed listing of specifications for all our cameras so you can choose the features and capabilities you need and want. Understanding the Specifications of Digital Cameras First of all, count your pixels! The most important number to be considered when buying a digital camera is the number of pixels or megapixels it captures. Pixels translate into resolution, and high resolution results in clear, crisp, and detailed photographs. Most magazines require an image to print with a minimum print resolution of 300ppi (pixels per inch) for publication. To get that kind of resolution for four- by six-inch prints, you're going to want at least a four-megapixel camera. If you plan on blowing pictures up to eight by ten inches, on the other hand, you're looking for at least 8 megapixels, and if you enter the rarified rangers above that, you have a professional-grade camera. Newegg carries cameras with up to 21 megapixels! For the highest quality digital photographs, get a camera that has at least 3X optical zoom. The less expensive cameras have digital zoom, but that zoom is restricted by the camera's resolution, and higher digital zoom images may appear blurry or pixilated. Here at Newegg, our most sophisticated digital cameras have 18X optical zoom. Shutter speeds are the other major factor to be considered when selecting a digital camera. The slower the shutter, the blurrier your pictures could be. If the shutter speed is 1/30, using a tripod is a must. When shutter speed is upwards of 1/125, you can take clear pictures of moving cars and trucks. In addition to the above specifications, you should also consider memory storage, battery life, the type of batteries the camera takes, and whether or not the camera is compatible with photo editing software. Many of the newer cameras support automated shooting modes which adjust the settings for you based on commonly-used situations. That, plus other features such as automatic image stabilization, which uses computer memory to refine an image in motion, or automatic face recognition, can help you get the most satisfaction for your dollar.", "parent_text": "Digital Cameras", "keyword_density": {"shoot": "0.2", "digital cameras": "2.5", "cameras": "2.2", "digital": "2.5"}, "department_id": 4},

Every picture should be clear and focused, but this may be difficult to do consistently if the camera is held in hand. Instead of thinking only about a photo's subject, photographers must make sure their hands are steady and have the correct angle for the shot. A camera tripod reduces those concerns, so these artists only have to think about what pictures to take. A tripod is a steady base for a camera that holds the device in a mounted, fixed position. Even the slightest movement on the photographer's part can cause an image to be blurry or out of focus. A camera stand eliminates the need for reshoots by eliminating much of the risk of human error. There are different tripods available depending on the chosen medium. Photographers mostly deal with still images, so it might be best to buy a stand with a static camera base to focus on one subject during a shot. For videographers who need to follow action while recording, a tripod with an adjustable head allows for easier panning. You should make sure all your equipment is safe during transport and easy to carry, as well. A bag can protect your new stand and some of your other equipment. Some carrying cases include extra padding and rigid outer shells to protect your camera from any accidents - like falling onto concrete or landing in water. Other bags are designed with a tripod in mind, so you can sling it over your shoulder and still have your hands free to take pictures while on the go. Whether you're a professional photographer or a hobbyist, it's important to make sure you're capturing an image as the eye sees it.", "parent_text": "Digital Camera Accessories", "keyword_density": {"camera": "2.3", "tripods": "0.3"}, "department_id": 4},

As with all digital home electronics, camera docks are available at various levels of sophistication for different photographic results. Advanced Digital Camera Docks versus Basic Docks Standard camera docks connect to your computer through a USB cable. The images are stored as JPEGs, allowing you to use any photo editor to crop, re-size, or edit the pictures in any way you like. If you have a high-level printer, you can print high-definition color photos either on standard paper or glossy photograph paper. The most basic printer docks, on the other hand, do not require the help of a computer. They produce photos in one size, usually four inches by six inches, which is the standard size you receive when your photos are developed at a store. Higher-level docks can print wallet-size photos, standard-size pictures, and a size in between the two. Using the more advanced printer docks, you can print several copies at once. The latest models have built-in image enhancers. If you want a printer dock, check for specifications on print speed and compatibility. Some docks do not require a physical connection to your camera, which is a great feature if you want to print photos taken on your phone camera.

If you've ever dreamed of creating an all-in-one system, audio and video cables can bring all your devices together when you've got them hooked together properly. In terms of bringing external signals into your receiver, a coaxial cable can bring you satellite or cable television, unless you're working with some old-school gaming hardware, in which case a splitter can help you hook multiples of this cable together. More recent audio and visual devices will use DVI or HDMI cables, which will provide connectivity for basically every television, computer, home theater and music device you may want to hook together. Composite cables come in a rainbow of colors to help you get high-definition video and stereo sound with just a single connection, but with HD televisions and newer gaming consoles, the variety has grown to epic proportions with endless customization possible. Firewire cables can even come in handy for connecting computers with televisions, in case you want to share your Internet experience with a group of people or just want a single monitor or television in your home to provide you with all your entertainment needs. Creating a fluid home entertainment experience can't be easier with proper audio and video cables to get maximum synergy going with your whole suite of technological toys.

With a number of sleek styles and variable options, Bluetooth headsets can integrate with phones, computers, music devices and more to increase ease of use and keep your hands free for more important things. Mono Bluetooth headsets clip over one ear and are useful for walking around in public or taking a call in the car where there are plenty of other things that require your attention. Keeping one ear open will alert you to other conversations or potential situations in your immediate area that require a response and Bluetooth headsets let you do just that without taking away the use of one of your hands. Also, seeing as many U.S. states have laws restricting phone use - including texting and phone calls - while driving, Bluetooth headsets will keep you in touch with friends and co-workers without the risk of getting a ticket or putting other motorists in danger. A stereo Bluetooth headset covers both ears and is useful for playing video games or listening to music. You can go out for a walk or to the gym with your iPod or MP3 player, and not worry about getting a headphone cord tangled on yourself or the workout equipment. You'll be able to get up from your computer and get a drink without taking off your headphones or missing out on a minute of in-game or online chatter. You can even sync it to your game consoles and use it to wirelessly talk to friends on your PS3, XBox or Wii.", "parent_text": "Portable Speakers", "keyword_density": {"bluetooth headsets": "2.9", "bluetooth": "1.8"}, "department_id": 4},

Paying for an international call isn't necessary if you have a USB mic for your PC or laptop, making talking to anyone around the world as easy as turning on the device. These gadgets connect quickly and easily, are functional with any computer and provide unlimited high-quality audio to anyone you can connect with. These are also handy for online gaming with programs like Ventrillo, which allow for in-game communication, so long as you have the right technology on your end. Built-in microphones just don't offer the same quality as an external USB microphone, with enhanced clarity and sound customization that gives them superior performance to a base-level device. If you've ever wanted to do audio and sound work with your computer or electrical instruments, these are essential for getting studio-grade results. The more upscale models still offer the same plug-and-play connectivity, but with automatic level adjustment, analog controls and signal muting, some rival even professional-grade tools. A USB microphone of high caliber frees you from the anchor of a computer, letting you set it up with a wired or wireless connection to provide the best possible customization and function. Whether you're chatting with a friend on Skype, owning noobs in World of Warcraft or cutting a new album with your garage band, microphones that come attached to your computer just won't give you the same level of performance that a USB microphone can provide.

There are portable devices at the ready to help meet your movie-watching needs with much less weight and more convenience than trying to jerry-rig conventional devices into a road-ready solution. A portable DVD player can hook up to any television with the right wires for immediate playback. Some are even equipped with Blu-ray technology, meaning you aren't limited to standard video quality if you purchase the right utility. These devices also have built-in screens, so if there's no TV present or the picture isn't good enough, you can just watch right on the device itself. What's more, portable DVD players are small, lightweight and compact, making them great for airplane and train travel. Some devices are so slim as to seem like tablet computers, while others feature multiple screens. One device holds the disk while the other maintains a wireless signal, allowing for several people to share the same viewing experience without everyone having to crowd around a single screen. Other models receive television signals and basic programming, while still others also come equipped for CD playback with built-in stereo speakers. These rigs look more like old-school boomboxes, but are still just as portable and multi-functional as their much slimmer brethren. Trading in profile for power, these devices provide far superior audio playback and can function as more than just a movie system, making it more of a full entertainment device that could be great for a child's room or a summer camp house. Great for home or on-the-go, portable DVD players allow for film viewing anywhere and anytime.

Writing them down on the go can be troublesome, especially if you are in a moving vehicle. Voice recorders are the perfect way to record your brilliant ideas without the need for cassette tapes or writing instruments. You can record memos, business meetings, an audio journal, and your phone conversations with these. Instead of storing the information on tape, the machines store them in digital formats. You can then transfer them to your computer to play them back or archive them, or send the audio files to other people through email. If you only need occasional voice recordings or basic functionality, a PDA or MP3 player with voice recording capability will probably suit your needs. However, if you're someone who needs to record conversations, you're better off with a dedicated digital voice recorder. Browse our site to find a large selection and the lowest prices on digital voice recording devices. While smartphones can do almost everything, their generalized functionality prevents the devices from excelling at some tasks. In addition, they have limited storage, and media files like recordings require large amounts of space. Content can easily be lost amid all of the documents stored on such devices, meaning that valuable information could be all but inaccessible. Additionally, some recorders have over 4GB of memory, meaning they can hold sizable libraries. Digital voice recorders only store audio files and can easily be connected to computers to export all documents. Some of these devices are equipped with built-in USB drives allowing you to easily save your notes once you're done recording. These specific models don't require wires, so they're more convenient to use while on the go. Sometimes you'll need to listen to something immediately, so reliable playback is a necessity. There are recorders with speakers and headphone jacks so you can listen to everything instantly without allowing anyone else to hear. Recorders feature strong battery life, so you never have to worry about them dying at an inopportune time. For instance, if you're recording a lecture, you shouldn't worry that you'll miss the conclusion because of a dead battery. Some audiophiles quickly notice the poor quality, especially in digital devices, and prefer analog gadgets. As an alternative, cassette recorders are also available. Some may argue that tapes are inefficient because they don't have large storage capacities, though tapes can be recycled so you don't have to frequently buy new ones. Whether you need to listen in on a business meeting after its conclusion or take personal notes throughout the day, a voice recorder may be one of the best possible gadgets for your job.", "parent_text": "Portable Devices", "keyword_density": {"voice recorders": "0.9", "voice": "1.5", "recorders": "1.3"}, "department_id": 4},

Mono Bluetooth headsets clip over one ear and are useful for walking around in public or taking a call in the car where there are plenty of other things that require your attention. Keeping one ear open will alert you to other conversations or potential situations in your immediate area that require a response and Bluetooth headsets let you do just that without taking away the use of one of your hands. Also, seeing as many U.S. states have laws restricting phone use - including texting and phone calls - while driving, Bluetooth headsets will keep you in touch with friends and co-workers without the risk of getting a ticket or putting other motorists in danger. A stereo Bluetooth headset covers both ears and is useful for playing video games or listening to music. You can go out for a walk or to the gym with your iPod or MP3 player, and not worry about getting a headphone cord tangled on yourself or the workout equipment. You'll be able to get up from your computer and get a drink without taking off your headphones or missing out on a minute of in-game or online chatter.

You can listen to your favorite MP3 songs on your stereo system or TV. You can look at your digital photos on your PC and turn them into slide shows for your TV, or listen to Internet radio stations from all over the world on your computer or stereo. Most players allow you to record digital content on your PC and transfer it to your player. This includes digital photos, hours of music, recorded TV programs and videos. Then you can listen to music while watching your slide show. The portable players are handy for taking on walks, airplanes, or long car rides. You can catch up on your TV shows while you're waiting in line at the grocery store or waiting for the dryer to finish at the laundromat. They hook up directly to your TV so you can play your content there, although the compression from the PC to the device might degrade the picture quality. Not all players work with all file types. You will need to look at the types of files you use most often and decide which ones you want your digital media player to handle.

If you frequently drive alone to new places, voice directions are desirable. While many GPS receivers have well-lit LCD displays, it can still be difficult to read while driving. You can always turn the voice off when you do not need it. If you like to measure distances or track your average speed, many GPS receivers can do this for you.

The car stereo is the device that most people turn to for entertainment during long rides. Whether they listen to news broadcasts or turn up their favorite songs, consumers enjoy hearing something other than their roaring engines and spinning tires. Auto manufacturers don't often put high-end stereos into their vehicles, but any system can be replaced with another that features more components and accessories than standard devices. Most models receive AM and FM signals, but certain radios have different features that not every driver will require. For instance, some models have LCD displays that use touchscreen navigation. These stereos may be more useful to consumers who think it's unsafe to use buttons and knobs while driving. Some devices have DVD players as well, allowing passengers to watch movies or TV shows during those long journeys. Less tech-savvy drivers may prefer radios that resemble their current models but boast increased functionality. Smartphones and MP3 players are commonly used to stream music and podcasts, so consumers may want a gadget that can sync with their mobile devices. Fortunately, radios with connection ports that are compatible with most wires are available. There are also some models with USB slots, while others use headphone jacks. Finally, some car stereos feature docks that ensure your mobile device is secure while you drive. If you don't want to tether your phone to your radio, you should consider a device with Bluetooth compatibility. The wireless technology can be convenient, but keep in mind that it can quickly drain your device's battery. The open road can be a quiet and lonely place, so you need a high quality stereo to listen to your favorite songs and broadcasts. You spend a long time in your car and should enjoy yourself while driving.

Whether you're looking to totally overhaul your interior and turn it into a performance machine or if you'd just prefer a boost in quality music enjoyment while on the go, car subwoofers will enhance your audio experience. To make your windows rattle, car subwoofers enhance bass quality by amplifying and feeding the audio signal back through an enclosure between 8 and 21 inches in diameter to produce a frequency of 20 to 200 Hz. The lower the frequency, the higher quality the sound will be - and the bigger the beats. The subwoofer will also filter out other frequencies, allowing for better quality and producing a clearer sound. Depending on the quality of your hardware and the inputs you provide it with, you can establish a crossover point where the treble and bass are perfectly balanced, providing the ultimate mix of highs and lows for playback enjoyment. For more balanced output, car subwoofers can give you the ability to fine-tune your listening experience in infinitely more satisfying ways than a standard car audio system right off the factory line can provide. Choosing your own hardware and getting a custom installation can give you the performance and quality you may only otherwise experience at the theater. Combining compact and affordable audio options that are on the level of high-end versions with sophisticated output adjustments, car subwoofers allow you to adjust your audio levels to optimize the listening experience.", "parent_text": "Car Electronics", "keyword_density": {"car": "2.7", "car subwoofers": "3.8"}, "department_id": 4},

When you make wrong turns, a GPS receiver will recalculate the route for you. Need a gas station? The more advanced receivers can lead you to the nearest one. Here at Newegg, we offer GPS receivers manufactured by the top companies in the industry. Our extensive collection includes receivers at a wide range of prices. Receivers also vary in terms of accuracy, display, and function. Our online catalog provides detailed specifications for all GPS receivers, which makes it easy for you to find something that meets your needs. How to Choose a GPS Receiver Almost all receivers are accurate within 15 meters, but some are even more exact. Another factor to consider is whether you need voice directions. If you frequently drive alone to new places, voice directions are desirable. While many GPS receivers have well-lit LCD displays, it can still be difficult to read while driving. You can always turn the voice off when you do not need it. If you like to measure distances or track your average speed, many GPS receivers can do this for you. And if you take long road trips that include several destinations, you may want a receiver that can store up to 50 locations.

With a number of sleek styles and variable options, Bluetooth headsets can integrate with phones, computers, music devices and more to increase ease of use and keep your hands free for more important things. Mono Bluetooth headsets clip over one ear and are useful for walking around in public or taking a call in the car where there are plenty of other things that require your attention. Keeping one ear open will alert you to other conversations or potential situations in your immediate area that require a response and Bluetooth headsets let you do just that without taking away the use of one of your hands. Also, seeing as many U.S. states have laws restricting phone use - including texting and phone calls - while driving, Bluetooth headsets will keep you in touch with friends and co-workers without the risk of getting a ticket or putting other motorists in danger. A stereo Bluetooth headset covers both ears and is useful for playing video games or listening to music. You can go out for a walk or to the gym with your iPod or MP3 player, and not worry about getting a headphone cord tangled on yourself or the workout equipment. You'll be able to get up from your computer and get a drink without taking off your headphones or missing out on a minute of in-game or online chatter.

Various automotive electronics are available to keep car rides entertaining and safe, while at the same time, providing us with our gadget fix. Automotive In-Car Accessories to Improve Safety and Entertain One example of popular automotive electronics is an audio transmitter that allows you to play music from a flash drive. If you don't have an MP3 player or CD player in your car, but you do have a vehicle and a flash drive, you could use this device to listen to MP3 files through your car stereo. You just need to load up your storage drive with MP3s and plug it into the USB port on the device. Then, you tune your radio into one of the preset FM channels and listen away! Automotive electronics can help enhance safety features, too. Rear view camera systems allow you to see and hear what is behind your vehicle. They have largely replaced rear view mirrors because they have wide-angle lenses and provide a clearer vision than mirrors. Using such a camera helps prevent accidents by allowing you to see a lot more of what's around you. Other automotive electronics that have become popular in the last few years include satellite radio systems, GPS navigation systems, DVD players, and video game systems. Hands-free headsets for cell phones, which have become required by law in many states, add an additional level of safety for those who need to talk and drive at the same time.

You need something with enough power to function almost the way a laptop would, but without the bulk and setup of that sort of device. A tablet, such as the ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity Tablet PC can offer portability and flexibility, with built-in media devices and a range of services that make it as handy as it is easy to handle. Tablets come in a range of sizes and shapes, either with Wi-Fi connectivity or through a dedicated provider like Sprint, AT&T or Verizon. These services require a regular contract like a mobile phone, but they can also get online anywhere and at any time, much like a smartphone can. This will provide the kind of overall use that professionals and casual users alike can truly appreciate. Available in a range of sizes, picking a screen size is only the first step in choosing the device that's right for you. As the advent of Ivy Bridge revolutionizes the computing power of ultra-slim devices , the best tablets are able to process more than some laptops at this point without having to tote around bulky or heavy tools. The largest tablets are about 10 inches across - similar in size to a netbook - yet lacking the external keyboard or hinged shell. Some of these have front-facing as well as rear-facing cameras, meaning you can chat online or take pictures and video with a larger mobile device, and then simply upload the content straight to the internet. Peripherals for tablets are as smart, sleek and small as the devices they're designed to support.

The smartphone features a taller, thinner body, a larger screen, a smaller connection port and the headphone jack has been moved to the bottom. This means consumers won't be able to fit their new iPhone in the same case as their old phone. There are two types of iPhone 5 cases to choose from - hard shells and soft body gloves. Both protect the device and help prevent any bumps and bruises from an accidental fall. Solid cases are slightly heavier than gel ones, but you may want the extra weight so your iPhone doesn't feel so fragile. You should pick the iPhone 5 cover that feels the most comfortable and unobtrusive when using your phone. Enclosures are available in almost every color as well, so your phone can look as good as it works. Gym-goers may want to buy an armband for extra security during a workout. It could be easy for an iPhone to slide out of your pocket while on the bench, and not even the best case could save it from being stepped on. Joggers may find it annoying to have their arms tangled with their headphones' wire extending all the way down to their pocket, but an armband could help avoid unwanted fuss during that last mile. The iPhone's new 4-inch screen has a gorgeous display, so it's important to protect the glass from any damage. A screen protector is a wise investment for all smartphone users who want to avoid small scratches all over their devices.

Additionally, drivers can find cradles that can be attached to their seatbelts, dashboards, air vents or windshields. Consumers can pick the right option for their needs so they can safely and conveniently answer their phones while behind the wheel. Alternatively, you can also find mounts for different smartphone models. Picking a specially designed cradle can provide extra security for your device and even improve its functionality. Some options feature signal boosting technology so you're never outside of your coverage area. iPhone 5 owners can also buy cradles that connect their phones with their cars. It may be beneficial to have a mount that charges a smartphone during long rides. Other models sync with a vehicle's sound system so that the iPhone's playback features can be used to replace the radio. Consider your needs before buying the perfect mount. For instance, if you frequently use your smartphone's GPS, consider a dashboard cradle so you can quickly check directions without taking your eyes off the road.

Installing a new battery can extend the life of any smartphone, as other hardware components don't lose functionality as quickly as the power sources. Some smartphones like the iPhone 5 and HTC Radar don't feature removable backs and require technical skill to replace the batteries. Mobile charging devices and special cases can provide extra power so that similar models don't become useless when their batteries die. Portable charging stations are available for some versions of the iPhone. The peripheral device connects to the phone's charging port. The mobile chargers are smaller than the iPhone, so they're convenient to carry and don't add unnecessary bulk. Many phones can be put into cases that have additional batteries. Similar to a mobile charger, the covers connect to phones and can double battery life. These devices must be regularly charged, but can usually last longer than smartphones without be connected to an external power source. The cases also protect smartphones from damage like scratches, cracks and chips. Alternatively, you could buy a mobile charger that runs on AA batteries. It can be inconvenient to have to charge your phone and a backup power source, so having a charger that runs on affordable batteries could be a simpler solution.

Smartphones, tablets and laptops are all prone to running out of power at the exact wrong moment, but it's not always possible to go home and connect your gadget to its charger. Fortunately, there are portable cables and AC adapters that are compatible with your car so you can keep your electronics alive. Many smartphones connect to outlets via USB cables. There are many devices that have USB ports, so almost any device can be connected to receive a quick boost. Some models even have multiple slots so that you can simultaneously charge all of your devices rather than waiting for each one to regain power. A wall charger could be the ideal purchase if you have a couple of gadgets and not enough outlets to plug them all in at once. Alternatively, a model that can connect with your vehicle's auxiliary jack is the best option if your devices frequently die when you're on the road. Of course, you can't use a USB model charger if your gadget isn't compatible with that type of connection. For instance, the iPhone 5 features a much different pin than many other smartphones, and some Windows Phones have micro-USB slots instead of their normal-sized counterparts. Luckily, there are chargers and cables for every style of connection port. You can find the correct model for your mobile device so that you're never caught without any power. Additionally, there are models available that feature different types of plugs and covers so that you only need one charger for all of your gadgets. Instead of carrying dozens of cables, you only need a single cord with interchangeable fixtures. It can be more convenient to only require one adapter.", "parent_text": "Batteries", "keyword_density": {"chargers and cables": "1.0", "cables": "1.3"}, "department_id": 7},

A rubber sleeve or a rigid shell can keep a mobile device working like new, even if it's frequently dropped. No two covers are exactly alike, and it's a shopper's responsibility to decide what type of protection is best for a smartphone. Sleeves are best suited to protect your phone's display and bezel from scuffs. The thin rubber layers are durable and don't add much weight, so your mobile device will still be convenient to use. Hard shells are designed to secure your phone's internal components during accidents. The rigid cases ensure that hardware won't be jostled or fall out of place and add additional heft to smartphones that feel flimsy. You should also consider finding a cover that protects your screen. The Otterbox Defender series for the iPhone 5 has a plastic shield to prevent dust particles from scratching the screens. In addition, other iPhone 5 cases are bundled with screen covers that you can install. Different cases may be more convenient for different situations. If you don't like carrying your phone in your pocket or bag, covers with belt clips are available. There are armbands that protect your device during your workout. You should also consider different aesthetics when it comes to your case. Your phone should be as fashionable as it is functional, and you can find sleeves with unique designs that suit your tastes. For instance, you can buy a solid black sleeve to give your device a sleek look. Of course, the most important consideration you should make is whether your smartphone will fit inside the case. If your protective sleeve isn't the proper size, your device may be damaged. Additionally, manufacturers install button covers for different phones, so some features may be inaccessible if you buy the wrong case.", "parent_text": "Cell Phones & Cell Phone Accessories", "keyword_density": {"mobile": "0.6", "phone": "3.5", "cases": "0.9", "covers": "1.3"}, "department_id": 7},

Fortunately, most gadgets can be wirelessly synced with Bluetooth headsets and speakers that offer strong audio performance. Many consumers were introduced to Bluetooth technology by the hands-free headsets some drivers used. The devices are convenient to set up and are much safer to use than answering the phone while behind the wheel. There are models that resemble older versions and are simple earpieces so you don't have to hold your smartphone. Alternatively, there are new Bluetooth accessories that connect your car's sound system with your cell phone. You simply plug the receiver into your vehicle's auxiliary jack and then pair it with your mobile device. The gadget can be placed on your wheel so that you never have to let go while driving when your phone rings. Other Bluetooth accessories can make your smartphone or MP3 player easier to use by eliminating wires. Instead of using traditional headphones, you can sync your device with a wireless model thanks to Bluetooth technology. These types of headphones can be especially useful during workouts when annoying cords can hinder certain motions. Bluetooth speakers allow you to play your favorite songs from your mobile device without having to leave it on a dock or tether it to your stereo. Simply pair your sound system with your smartphone and you can fill any room with your music. One of the benefits of using Bluetooth speakers is that you can move around with your gadget without hurting the connection.

We've made it a priority to carry home theater systems at prices that anyone can appreciate. Take a look at a few examples, which run the gamut from incredibly affordable systems to the most high-quality models. The primary draw, for many of those looking to acquire a home theater system, is the surround sound - hearing and feeling the strains of the musical score, sound effects and dialogue swirl around you and transport you to another place. A system worth its salt, so to speak, should have four satellite speakers, a center channel and a powerful subwoofer, to experience the loudest bass booms and the quietest dialogue in crystal clarity. Many systems at various price tiers feature that exact speaker layout. Those looking for a set-up that's a little bit simpler and involves less chance of cables becoming confusingly intertwined can find systems with wireless speakers. While no sound system can be truly \"wireless,\" some feature two or more speakers that use an infra-red connection and help you cut down on clutter. Despite all that talk about sound, the image is - of course - just as important. Your primary choice will be between a home theater with a Blu-ray or DVD player. The former can play films on either format, and obviously provides high sound and picture quality in resolution as high as 1080p. A system featuring the latter, meanwhile, will be significantly cheaper in almost all instances. That said, Blu-ray is becoming a more common format in today's market, and as such it's more affordable for the average consumer than ever before. Take a close look and you'll be sure to find a home theater system that meets your needs and doesn't make you break the bank.", "parent_text": "Home Audio", "keyword_density": {"home theater systems": "0.9", "home theater": "3.1", "systems": "1.2"}, "department_id": 4},

This big black box is the epicenter of your home audio experience, the brains behind the nervous system of a/v cables connecting the television to its speakers and your home entertainment center. While it may seem unassuming, stereo receivers are what make or break a home audio setup. The stereo receiver is the main input and output that controls the rest of an audio arrangement. It dictates the number and variety of speakers you can install, the kind of video devices you can connect to it and the amount of power you can expect to get from your outputs. DVD players, video game consoles, television sets and audio devices will all want a piece of the stereo receiver's action, so getting a high-end, well-constructed unit is key to optimal audio production and the best video experience. For example, a movie may be scary because of its visuals, but it's the sound that makes it terrifying. The best receivers will not only hook together CD and DVD players, radio inputs, television and gaming devices, they also bring a level of immersion and entertainment you couldn't hope to achieve with anything less. Low-end and mid-range stereo receivers may be perfectly fine for basic DVD and television watching.

These devices may integrate easily with home speakers and other amplifiers, sound systems and entertainment tools to boost your experience. A solid speaker system will give you a subwoofer and a few additional speakers to move the sound around. These can be wired or wireless, depending on receivers and connections, and they can accelerate in price and quality fairly quickly for serious audiophiles. Low-profile speakers may work for some spaces, but for bigger sound, you may want bigger speakers. Subwoofers in particular can add a lot to the viewing experience, so skimping on that unit could rob you of audio content. Sizes and designs are equally varied. Finishes come in a number of colors, including faux and real wood containers, cloths and plastics, with unique design elements to match whatever style your entertainment space and tastes require. It's possible to purchase innocuous home speakers without losing out on sound, so if you're concerned about making tower speakers fit into your space, know that quality of sound is not limited from you by design. Some home speakers will be inherently more expensive because of brand or design, but know that value-priced systems aren't necessarily all that bad. Look for high bass values in the subwoofer and at least three satellite speakers to provide something of a surround-sound experience.

Many Blu-ray players now boast incredibly useful special features in addition to the astounding picture and sound quality available through their HDMI capabilities.

In some models, content can be transferred from the player to a laptop, smartphone or tablet and playing it on the smaller device. Additionally, the average Blu-ray player often allows you to store music, video, photos and other media by uploading it via a USB device. Some - typically those on the moderate to high end of the price spectrum - are also programmed to be 3D capable and will produce even more stunning images when paired with an appropriately outfitted television. Sometimes, though, the most useful features are some of the simplest. With a typical Blu-ray player, one of its primary attributes is the ability to improve the audio and visual quality of the DVDs you use it to watch.

In terms of bringing external signals into your receiver, a coaxial cable can bring you satellite or cable television, unless you're working with some old-school gaming hardware, in which case a splitter can help you hook multiples of this cable together. More recent audio and visual devices will use DVI or HDMI cables, which will provide connectivity for basically every television, computer, home theater and music device you may want to hook together. Composite cables come in a rainbow of colors to help you get high-definition video and stereo sound with just a single connection, but with HD televisions and newer gaming consoles, the variety has grown to epic proportions with endless customization possible. Firewire cables can even come in handy for connecting computers with televisions, in case you want to share your Internet experience with a group of people or just want a single monitor or television in your home to provide you with all your entertainment needs. Creating a fluid home entertainment experience can't be easier with proper audio and video cables to get maximum synergy going with your whole suite of technological toys.

You may also want to save space in your entertainment unit for other devices like audio tuners and video game consoles. The best solution for size and convenience is a TV DVD combo that puts both utilities into a single device. These devices come in a variety of sizes and styles similar to any conventional television, save that they have a DVD player built right into the screen. One remote control is all that's needed to switch between regular cable and movie viewing. Some units are also equipped with radio tuners and under-shelf installation kits for kitchen use or other areas with minimal shelf space, enhancing flexibility and maximizing room usage. Built-in players can be standard DVD or Blu-ray, depending on the model purchased. LCD and HD displays are another variable to decide upon before making a purchase. There's no difference in picture quality between a standard television and one with DVD capability, so approaching it like a regular TV purchase with added usability is one perk to picking this multi-faceted device. They have all the same connectivity and require no different cables than a standard television, meaning it's no extra investment if you are just replacing a couple of existing devices to save space. Functional, flexible and fun, TV DVD combo devices provide the best of both movies and TV without having to switch remotes.

All the equipment needs to be compatible to give an audience the best viewing experience. Due to strides in technology, audio devices can make movies and television shows sound crystal clear, but a standard high-definition television's picture might lag behind a sound system's performance. Buying the best home theater projector could level the playing field. If you're going to be watching a great deal of programming, a projector might be easier on the eyes than an LCD or LED television. The devices are backlit to create a sharper image on screen, while sending light directly into your vision. This is what usually causes eye strain after watching for an extended period of time. Projectors are only directing light toward the screen, making it more comfortable to enjoy a movie marathon. There is more flexibility with a home theater projector, as well. Instead of having a television with a set size, a projector can be adjusted to fill bigger and smaller display areas. Moving the device further away from the screen creates a bigger image, while moving it closer shrinks it. This is a convenient adjustment for users who want to use their device in more than one room. It is important to note the minimum and maximum size settings on each projector, because picture quality will deteriorate if moved beyond those thresholds. You may want to consider the lamp life of a projector before making a purchase. Light bulbs don't last forever, so at some point you'll need to replace one in your device. Most projectors offer settings designed to lengthen a bulb's life, but these options may reduce viewing quality while cutting down on power consumption. It's important to consider all your needs before buying a home theater projector. Make sure you have figured out what you expect from the device and what you'll use it for, so you can buy the best one for your home theater.", "parent_text": "Projectors", "keyword_density": {"home theater": "3.0", "projectors": "0.6"}, "department_id": 4},

We've made it a priority to carry home theater systems at prices that anyone can appreciate. Take a look at a few examples, which run the gamut from incredibly affordable systems to the most high-quality models. The primary draw, for many of those looking to acquire a home theater system, is the surround sound - hearing and feeling the strains of the musical score, sound effects and dialogue swirl around you and transport you to another place. A system worth its salt, so to speak, should have four satellite speakers, a center channel and a powerful subwoofer, to experience the loudest bass booms and the quietest dialogue in crystal clarity. Many systems at various price tiers feature that exact speaker layout. Those looking for a set-up that's a little bit simpler and involves less chance of cables becoming confusingly intertwined can find systems with wireless speakers. While no sound system can be truly \"wireless,\" some feature two or more speakers that use an infra-red connection and help you cut down on clutter. Despite all that talk about sound, the image is - of course - just as important. Your primary choice will be between a home theater with a Blu-ray or DVD player. The former can play films on either format, and obviously provides high sound and picture quality in resolution as high as 1080p. A system featuring the latter, meanwhile, will be significantly cheaper in almost all instances. That said, Blu-ray is becoming a more common format in today's market, and as such it's more affordable for the average consumer than ever before.

A bulb behind the glass lights up the display whenever a current is passed through the LCD solution. Plasma screens also have two sheets of glass but between them is a layer of phosphor pixels. When UV rays strike the pixels, the gas in them glows. Essentially, each pixel is its own fluorescent light bulb. On large TV screens, such as those in the 60 to 63 inch range, plasma displays typically outperform LCD displays with plasma units displaying a brighter, crisper image even at large sizes. Top LCD's have gotten close in performance, however, it will cost you. A major selling point and advantage to both types of monitors is their thin, flat size.

Pros and Cons Both Plasma and LCD TV's are thin, lightweight and easy to move, with most being wall-mountable, providing drastically greater options for home theatre setup. Both boast long display life's of about 60,000 hours or roughly 20 years if used 8 hours a day although this can vary according to other environmental and use factors. Additionally, both offer HDTV options in 720P, 1080i, and 1080p depending on size of screen. Considerations of Plasma TVs include excellent picture quality, wide viewing angles, and they are usually available in screen sizes from 37 inches to 60+. However they do tend to have glass screens that can reflect room lighting. Considerations of LCD TVs include excellent picture quality, have matte screens for less external light reflection, and they are usually available in screen sizes from 5 inches to 50+. However their viewing angles aren't as extreme as plasmas. What should you consider before purchase? LCD televisions are currently available in a variety of screen sizes and dimensions. LCD TVs are now available in screen sizes exceeding 50 inches. A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions. LCD TV screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD television can support. An LCD television typically provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 4:3 , similar to a standard monitor's aspect ratio of 5:4. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD television's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD television\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD televisions today can provide over 500 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Contrast Ratio is the degree of variation of the whitest and darkest parts of the image, is a very important factor to note. If the LCD TV has a low contrast ratio, dark images will look muddy and gray, while light images will look washed out. A good contrast ratio to have in an LCD TV is 1,000:1 or higher. Almost all LCD-TVs have built-in NTSC tuners , with some feature dual-tuners for PIP functions. An increasing number of new LCD-TVs also have built-in HDTV tuners .", "parent_text": "Televisions", "keyword_density": {"lcd": "3.3", "right": "0.4", "plasma": "0.9", "vs": "0.9"}, "department_id": 4},

If you're looking to enjoy your favorite high-powered action movies, raucous comedies and heartbreaking dramas in the best possible way, you'll thrill to the visual clarity and room-shaking sound that's available with the following Blu-ray players. Check out the players we have in stock and get started on your search! Many Blu-ray players now boast incredibly useful special features in addition to the astounding picture and sound quality available through their HDMI capabilities. Some include web browsers that connect through Wi-Fi, user interfaces that allow access to streaming video or music content through apps such as Netflix\u00ae, Hulu Plus\u00ae and Pandora\u00ae. In some models, content can be transferred from the player to a laptop, smartphone or tablet and playing it on the smaller device. Additionally, the average Blu-ray player often allows you to store music, video, photos and other media by uploading it via a USB device. Some - typically those on the moderate to high end of the price spectrum - are also programmed to be 3D capable and will produce even more stunning images when paired with an appropriately outfitted television. Sometimes, though, the most useful features are some of the simplest. With a typical Blu-ray player, one of its primary attributes is the ability to improve the audio and visual quality of the DVDs you use it to watch. This prevents you from having to get rid of your existing DVD collection, while also allowing you to experience all of those films and TV shows with enhanced picture and sound.", "parent_text": "Televisions", "keyword_density": {"blu ray": "3.5", "players": "1.1", "blu ray players": "2.1"}, "department_id": 4},

You may also want to save space in your entertainment unit for other devices like audio tuners and video game consoles. The best solution for size and convenience is a TV DVD combo that puts both utilities into a single device. These devices come in a variety of sizes and styles similar to any conventional television, save that they have a DVD player built right into the screen. One remote control is all that's needed to switch between regular cable and movie viewing. Some units are also equipped with radio tuners and under-shelf installation kits for kitchen use or other areas with minimal shelf space, enhancing flexibility and maximizing room usage. Built-in players can be standard DVD or Blu-ray, depending on the model purchased. LCD and HD displays are another variable to decide upon before making a purchase. There's no difference in picture quality between a standard television and one with DVD capability, so approaching it like a regular TV purchase with added usability is one perk to picking this multi-faceted device. They have all the same connectivity and require no different cables than a standard television, meaning it's no extra investment if you are just replacing a couple of existing devices to save space. Functional, flexible and fun, TV DVD combo devices provide the best of both movies and TV without having to switch remotes.

After all the effort you put into picking a carrier and a plan you like and building your mobile life on their data plan, why shouldn't you be able to get your dream phone, like the iPhone 5 , too? Unlocked phones can be paired up with a new or existing plan and don't come with contract requirements right out of the box. You don't even have to change your phone number with unlocked phones - just carry over all your data on a new SIM card and you'll have access to contacts, photos and messages without struggling to back up and then transfer information from one phone to another. Best of all, if you're using no contract phones already you know it couldn't be simpler to update your existing model when cool new technology rolls out. It's as simple as buying an unlocked version of the new model and changing out your card, and you're ready to go. Using interchangeable SIM cards also allows you to take an exclusive product and turn it into a universal phone that's compatible with virtually every carrier. If you plan to travel outside the U.S. any time soon, getting your hands on no contract phones means you don't have to ditch your technology when you go overseas. Just swap the SIM for a global carrier's card or change it out for an international version of your current model and you'll be set to sail. Even if you aren't going to need your passport when you travel, coverage can be spotty in areas for some carriers, but when using no contract phones you don't have to worry about that issue, thanks to exchangeable SIM cards.", "parent_text": "Cell Phones - Unlocked", "keyword_density": {"phones": "1.6", "unlocked": "0.9"}, "department_id": 7},

If you've ever dreamed of creating an all-in-one system, audio and video cables can bring all your devices together when you've got them hooked together properly. In terms of bringing external signals into your receiver, a coaxial cable can bring you satellite or cable television, unless you're working with some old-school gaming hardware, in which case a splitter can help you hook multiples of this cable together. More recent audio and visual devices will use DVI or HDMI cables, which will provide connectivity for basically every television, computer, home theater and music device you may want to hook together. Composite cables come in a rainbow of colors to help you get high-definition video and stereo sound with just a single connection, but with HD televisions and newer gaming consoles, the variety has grown to epic proportions with endless customization possible. Firewire cables can even come in handy for connecting computers with televisions, in case you want to share your Internet experience with a group of people or just want a single monitor or television in your home to provide you with all your entertainment needs. Creating a fluid home entertainment experience can't be easier with proper audio and video cables to get maximum synergy going with your whole suite of technological toys.

A bulb behind the glass lights up the display whenever a current is passed through the LCD solution. Plasma screens also have two sheets of glass but between them is a layer of phosphor pixels. When UV rays strike the pixels, the gas in them glows. Essentially, each pixel is its own fluorescent light bulb.

Top LCD's have gotten close in performance, however, it will cost you. A major selling point and advantage to both types of monitors is their thin, flat size.

Pros and Cons Both Plasma and LCD TV's are thin, lightweight and easy to move, with most being wall-mountable, providing drastically greater options for home theatre setup. Both boast long display life's of about 60,000 hours or roughly 20 years if used 8 hours a day although this can vary according to other environmental and use factors. Additionally, both offer HDTV options in 720P, 1080i, and 1080p depending on size of screen. Considerations of Plasma TVs include excellent picture quality, wide viewing angles, and they are usually available in screen sizes from 37 inches to 60+. However they do tend to have glass screens that can reflect room lighting. Considerations of LCD TVs include excellent picture quality, have matte screens for less external light reflection, and they are usually available in screen sizes from 5 inches to 50+. However their viewing angles aren't as extreme as plasmas. What should you consider before purchase? LCD televisions are currently available in a variety of screen sizes and dimensions. LCD TVs are now available in screen sizes exceeding 50 inches. A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions. LCD TV screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD television can support. An LCD television typically provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 4:3 , similar to a standard monitor's aspect ratio of 5:4. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD television's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD television\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD televisions today can provide over 500 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Contrast Ratio is the degree of variation of the whitest and darkest parts of the image, is a very important factor to note. If the LCD TV has a low contrast ratio, dark images will look muddy and gray, while light images will look washed out. A good contrast ratio to have in an LCD TV is 1,000:1 or higher. Almost all LCD-TVs have built-in NTSC tuners , with some feature dual-tuners for PIP functions. An increasing number of new LCD-TVs also have built-in HDTV tuners .", "parent_text": "Televisions", "keyword_density": {"lcd": "3.3", "right": "0.4", "plasma": "0.9", "vs": "0.9"}, "department_id": 4},

Buying the best home theater projector could level the playing field. If you're going to be watching a great deal of programming, a projector might be easier on the eyes than an LCD or LED television. The devices are backlit to create a sharper image on screen, while sending light directly into your vision. This is what usually causes eye strain after watching for an extended period of time. Projectors are only directing light toward the screen, making it more comfortable to enjoy a movie marathon. There is more flexibility with a home theater projector, as well. Instead of having a television with a set size, a projector can be adjusted to fill bigger and smaller display areas. Moving the device further away from the screen creates a bigger image, while moving it closer shrinks it. This is a convenient adjustment for users who want to use their device in more than one room. It is important to note the minimum and maximum size settings on each projector, because picture quality will deteriorate if moved beyond those thresholds. You may want to consider the lamp life of a projector before making a purchase. Light bulbs don't last forever, so at some point you'll need to replace one in your device. Most projectors offer settings designed to lengthen a bulb's life, but these options may reduce viewing quality while cutting down on power consumption. It's important to consider all your needs before buying a home theater projector. Make sure you have figured out what you expect from the device and what you'll use it for, so you can buy the best one for your home theater.", "parent_text": "Projectors", "keyword_density": {"home theater": "3.0", "projectors": "0.6"}, "department_id": 4},

Models of the DS (with the exception of the DS Lite) range from 3.25 to 4.2 inches in terms of screen width. While this is certainly small, visibility is never a struggle, and it provides remarkable clarity and graphic quality despite its compact dimensions. Newer versions of the DS feature the stock Camera and Sound applications, which make on-the-go photography, music and sound recording a breeze. Some models also include pre-installed software such as Brain Age and Photo Clock. Perhaps more importantly, though, is the device's Wi-Fi readiness.

As far as controls are concerned, you'll notice a great deal of flexibility with the Nintendo DS. In addition to the standard buttons, certain games and functions allow you to take advantage of the touch-screen stylus that comes with the console. For the games and applications that use it, this option provides notable ease of use and plenty of fun. Another one of the DS' greatest attributes is the wide spectrum of games available.

The console was the first to feature motion controls, allowing gamers' gestures to control the on-screen action instead of traditional button commands. In November Nintendo will unveil the Wii's successor - Wii U. One of the most notable updates the gaming giant has included is a larger controller. The previous generation of the console featured a motion-sensing controller with a detachable analog stick. The Nintendo Wii U uses a large GamePad. The controller has all the standard buttons and navigational tools, but also features a touchscreen display and a camera. For gamers who don't want to learn how to use a new controller, the Wii U Pro Controller is a more traditional peripheral, as it has no screen. If you want to use the GamePad, you'll have to keep it charged. Batteries die quickly and it can be annoying to tether your controller to the console. Despite this, the GamePad Stand/Cradle keeps your controller alive, so you don't have to worry about it dying in the middle of a game. While the Wii U offers a host of features, including popular streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, the games are the main attractions. As has been the case with previous Nintendo console releases, there is a new \"Super Mario Bros.\" title debuting alongside the Wii U. There's also \"Nintendo Land Wii U,\" a game that demonstrates all of the Wii U's new features through mini games, much like \"Wii Sports\" for the Wii. Gamers aren't limited to Nintendo-produced titles either, as two massive franchises are coming to the Wii U. \"Call of Duty: Black Ops II\" and \"Rayman Legends\" are both the latest installments of popular series with two entirely different styles of game play.", "parent_text": "Gaming", "keyword_density": {"u": "15.3", "wii u": "5.2", "wii": "3.9"}, "department_id": 6},

The Wii also boasts a massive library of exceptional titles. Every console comes bundled with \"Wii Sports,\" which went from a technical demonstration to one of Nintendo's biggest hits. The game features boxing, bowling, baseball, tennis and golf and teaches players how to use the motion controls. Nintendo also brought back fan-favorite characters like Mario, Kirby and Donkey Kong. Nintendo also brought in third-party publishers to produce some of the Wii's best games.

Unlike previous models, the 3DS features two screens and a flip cover to protect both displays from damage. Most games use the smaller screen as a map, leaving the main action to take place on the larger one. Both displays include 3D graphics that you can customize. The handheld includes a switch that allows you to increase and decrease the graphic quality on both screens. At its highest level, the 3DS can compete with most in-home 3D televisions in terms of clarity and performance. As a result of the strong graphics, many of the games available for the 3DS are comparable to those found on consoles like the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 . Many titles are available for the device so gamers can play their favorite games on-the-go. Additionally, there are exclusives like \"Rayman Origins\" and the video game adaption of the popular cartoon \"Adventure Time\" that are only available for the 3DS. Accessories can make gaming even more enjoyable on the handheld. For instance, there's a case modeled after a steering wheel so you can pretend you're really driving when playing racing games. Other cases might not be as suited to gaming, but they can protect your 3DS while making it very stylish. Metallic cases can protect your handheld from accidental drops, while silicone sleeves are equally durable and don't add unnecessary bulk to your 3DS.

With streaming services, a built-in Blu-ray player and internet connectivity, there are plenty of ways you can stay entertained with Sony's console. Picking out the right PS3 accessories can create an even better experience while using the device, by enhancing all of its best features. A controller is a basic necessity for every user. Consoles typically only come with one, so having extra controllers is necessary if you want to invite friends to play a game. You can pick and choose from numerous colors. Don't forget to buy a charger, as well. PS3s sync with new controllers via the wired connection, and without it, once a battery dies it's dead for good. For people that use video services but have a hard time searching for movies and TV shows with the on-screen keyboard, there are external keyboards available. You won't have to navigate to different letters with the analog sticks after buying a mini-keyboard that syncs with your PS3. As the Blu-ray player was a major part of the PS3's appeal for many, a remote control may be more intuitive to use than controllers and make on-screen navigation much simpler. Additionally, movies will look even better with a HDMI cable for a higher resolution picture. For gamers who like to play online, a headset may be the perfect accessory to enhance the experience. You can use this tool to strategize with teammates or psych out an opponent during a heated basketball or football game. Buying the right PlayStation 3 accessories can make the console even more fun to use and enhance all your favorite features.", "parent_text": "Gaming", "keyword_density": {"ps3": "1.3", "ps3 accessories": "0.7", "accessories": "0.7"}, "department_id": 6},

However, some of these movements may feel disjointed and unnatural without the help of certain Wii accessories. Sports games especially benefit from these peripherals. Attachments give the controller a much more realistic feel, so you won't have to suffer a ponderous pantomime when you're trying to golf or play tennis, two of the most popular activities on the console.

Of course, having a controller in the first place is essential, and the Wii only comes with one white Wii-mote and Nunchuck. The colors and shapes available for the system are much broader than that one option, however. You can mix and match colors and finishes, or even switch out wristbands to totally personalize the look and feel.

Be sure to also buy the right kind of cables as part of your Wii accessories purchase.

Fans of first-person shooters or similarly combat-heavy games will certainly have plenty of options on their hands. As far as genres go, these action-packed titles run the gamut from Renaissance-era swashbuckling and sci-fi dystopia to modern warfare and crime sagas. Additionally, intense role-playing games (RPGs) and real-time strategy (RTS) titles are available. Options in this category include games from established franchises like Diablo, Starcraft and Age of Empires to newer favorite series such as Fallout and The Elder Scrolls. However, those games aren't for everyone, and some are rated either T for Teen or M for Mature - intended for adults and teenagers of a certain age and maturity level. Parents, never fear - we've got plenty of other options for younger gamers and those uninterested in combat. These also encompass a wide variety of genres, as you could be creating entire new worlds in games like The Sims, planning culinary domination in Restaurant Empire or testing your wits with puzzle- and gambling-themed titles. You'll even have no trouble finding sports games or options that are suitable for even the youngest players.

The PlayStation 4 has added several new weapons to its arsenal in terms of functionality in comparison to the PS3 . Sporting an eight core x86-64 AMD \"Jaguar\" CPU alongside a 1.84 teraflop GPU and supported by 8GB of GDDR5 RAM and a 500GB mechanical hard drive, the PS4 represents an advanced level of gaming currently considered to be top-of-the-line. In the competitive gaming industry, the battle with Microsoft is probably the most intense, and some are saying that the advanced powers of the PS4 are going to keep it well ahead of the Xbox One for the remainder of this generation. PlayStation 4 additions since the PS3 While the PlayStation4 has not changed in fundamental ways since its predecessor, there have definitely been some improvements under the hood, so to speak. The 8GB of RAM represents a 16-time increase in memory from the PS3. The PS4 also boasts faster USB outputs, a touchpad controller and an advanced camera. The PlayStation Store has also undergone some changes. All games can be purchased in either a traditional, physical format or via digital download. Game downloads have been reported to take as little as an hour to complete, and titles can even be played before they have finished installing. Some games that were recently released like Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Call of Duty: Ghosts, can be upgraded to PS4-quality versions for a small, one-time fee. Being backwards compatible, however, the PlayStation 4 will still play the old disc. PlayStation 4 performance upgrades In terms of how the PS4 performs compared to the PS3, one has only to look at the specifications. The hardware used to build the new console represents a major advancement for gamers. The menu screen, for one, has been streamlined compared to the reportedly dense interface of the PS3. Two horizontal feeds now separate games, apps, trophies and friends on the PlayStation 4 in a more easily-viewable way than its predecessor did. Cold boot times have been known to bring the home screen up and instantly usable in under 30 seconds with less icon pop-in than before. Streaming apps, like Netflix and Amazon, are also organized into their own folder, keeping them readily accessible. The faster processors have also yielded advanced graphic outputs with almost nonexistent load times for a variety of games. These improved visuals also extend to media streaming apps and discs inserted into the Blu-Ray drive. Overall, the PlayStation 4 has both met and exceeded the expectations that Sony has laid out for itself.

A major feature that distinguishes the PlayStation 3 from its predecessors is it's unified online gaming service, the PlayStation Network, which contrasts with Sony's former policy of relying on game developers for online play. Other major features of the console include its robust multimedia capabilities, connectivity with the PlayStation Portable, and its use of a high-definition optical disc format, Blu-ray Disc, as its primary storage medium. The PS3 was also the first Blu-ray 2.0-compliant Blu-ray player on the market. PS3 Games Imagine you own a PlayStation 3. It plays movies, connects to the internet, lets you hang out and chat with your friends and gives you Hulu and Netflix at the touch of a button. But let's be honest, you didn't buy it to play downloadable games or shoot the breeze with your friends. You're looking to shoot aliens, storm castles, explore unknown lands and have silly, wacky adventures. For that you're going to need some PS3 games. If you've walked into a game store recently you've probably noticed there are hundreds of titles to choose from, and walking in circles and staring at the walls isn't the best way to find out more about a title. Box art may look cool, but it won't necessarily give you information on HUD interfaces, gameplay graphics or continuity of storyline. Deciding on a genre is always a great place to start. First-person shooters, role playing, driving, action, adventure, horror, strategy, sports and fighting titles from various game studios are out in force. That's right, you also have to decide if you like Rockstar to Konami, EA over Activision, or Square Enix more than Namco. One of the other things to take into account is the rating. Not everyone wants to see blood and gore, but some gamers like the realistic intensity of games with more mature ratings. When buying as a gift, it may not be the best decision to buy an M-rated game, so be mindful of the ESRB's handy guidelines while selecting your games. Purchasing PS3 games can take a little time, but usually it will be love at first sight. Go with your gut, pick a genre and a plotline you love, and sit down for hours of quality time with your PlayStation once you have all the PS3 games to rock it with.", "parent_text": "Gaming", "keyword_density": {"playstation": "2.1", "3": "2.3", "playstation 3": "1.8"}, "department_id": 6},

The console offers access to music, movies, sports, and, of course, video games. It may be a great media hub, but without the right peripheral devices it may be difficult to enjoy the 360's full potential. If you want to go online with the console you need a subscription to Xbox LIVE. The service is offered in monthly increments, so you can decide what time frame meets your needs to avoid wasteful spending on a subscription. If you want to buy any games, movies, or music from Microsoft's online store make sure you have plenty of Microsoft Points. Spare controllers are necessary for gamers who plan on playing with others. Rechargeable batteries and charging stations are available so gamers don't have to find a new pair of AA's every time power is running low. You could also replace the controller with your own movements by adding Kinect to your 360. Adding the motion sensor bar to the console gives you the ability to control your content with gestures and voice commands. While starting a movie by telling your Xbox to \"play disc\" may be convenient, playing games on Kinect may be awkward for some users who need an object to interact with and can't just act out certain activities. For example, a bowling ball replica may make bowling more fun and feel less like a game of charades. Make sure your device is well-connected with all the right wires and cords. Kinect's motion sensor can be moved further away from a television to prevent any motion-related accidents. Finally, don't forget an HDMI cable so all your favorite games, movies and shows are displayed in the highest possible picture quality.", "parent_text": "Gaming", "keyword_density": {"xbox 360": "0.7", "360": "1.0", "xbox": "1.0"}, "department_id": 6},

Most of the Mac line focuses on strength and portability, and being able to integrate a PC experience onto an Apple product is one of the best features available for users of both kinds of technology. Running parallel desktops with Parallels allows a user to have both a Mac and a PC experience at the same time on one machine. Microsoft Office has a Mac version available of its most popular suite of programs, including PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook, Access and Documents. This package is available for basic users, as well as student or professional versions to accommodate those with more specific needs and uses for the software. There are even font packages that allow for more customization of banners, fliers and other documents created in these formats. Graphic design and drawing are also easy with specialized programs. Adobe's CS6 and Photoshop elements offer custom packages just for Mac users, and even AutoCAD gets suites from Autodesk. Music maestros also have software to help create and record tracks, mix tapes and create custom sounds. Video editors get a share of the action too, with suites from roxio that allow cropping, special effects and even transfer of files from older formats to DVD. Of course, protecting a Mac is also a huge responsibility, and custom software exists to meet this end. Symantec and Trend Micro have programs specifically designed to cope with the burgeoning online threat to the infrastructure that exists for Apple products.

However, those games aren't for everyone, and some are rated either T for Teen or M for Mature - intended for adults and teenagers of a certain age and maturity level. Parents, never fear - we've got plenty of other options for younger gamers and those uninterested in combat. These also encompass a wide variety of genres, as you could be creating entire new worlds in games like The Sims, planning culinary domination in Restaurant Empire or testing your wits with puzzle- and gambling-themed titles. You'll even have no trouble finding sports games or options that are suitable for even the youngest players. Our wide stock and affordable pricing - many titles are under $20 and even some newer computer games are well below their original MSRP - guarantees you'll be able to find the PC games best suited to your tastes, as well as your wallet!", "parent_text": "PC Games & Accessories", "keyword_density": {"pc games": "1.3", "games": "3.5"}, "department_id": 5},

The console offers access to music, movies, sports, and, of course, video games. It may be a great media hub, but without the right peripheral devices it may be difficult to enjoy the 360's full potential. If you want to go online with the console you need a subscription to Xbox LIVE. The service is offered in monthly increments, so you can decide what time frame meets your needs to avoid wasteful spending on a subscription. If you want to buy any games, movies, or music from Microsoft's online store make sure you have plenty of Microsoft Points. Spare controllers are necessary for gamers who plan on playing with others. Rechargeable batteries and charging stations are available so gamers don't have to find a new pair of AA's every time power is running low. You could also replace the controller with your own movements by adding Kinect to your 360. Adding the motion sensor bar to the console gives you the ability to control your content with gestures and voice commands. While starting a movie by telling your Xbox to \"play disc\" may be convenient, playing games on Kinect may be awkward for some users who need an object to interact with and can't just act out certain activities. For example, a bowling ball replica may make bowling more fun and feel less like a game of charades. Make sure your device is well-connected with all the right wires and cords. Kinect's motion sensor can be moved further away from a television to prevent any motion-related accidents. Finally, don't forget an HDMI cable so all your favorite games, movies and shows are displayed in the highest possible picture quality.", "parent_text": "Xbox 360", "keyword_density": {"xbox 360": "0.7", "360": "1.0", "xbox": "1.0"}, "department_id": 6},

Professionals are fond of Adobe Photoshop and InDesign, but others find that they take too much time to learn or cost too much for the average home user. Fortunately, here at Newegg, you'll find all sorts of image editing software for all your creative needs. Less expensive digital imaging and editing software programs are not always less than adequate. Some offer great value and may or may not be easier to use. Mid-level programs contain more features than the basics yet are easier to learn than advanced programs like Photoshop. However, if you are designing documents that will be commercially printed and need color separation, make sure the software supports CMYK. PaintShop Pro is one example of a mid-level program that is affordable enough for the average user and easier to learn than Photoshop. Graphics Suites with Digital Imaging and Editing Software Programs Suites of image editing programs will help you with vector-based drawing and pixel-based image editing. Some come with organizational tools that help you categorize your photos, mark them for editing and printing, as well as improve them with color correction and other effects. You'll have creative control as well as an easy time learning how to use the software. You can also turn your photos into slide shows or video productions to share with family and friends. CorelDraw Graphics Suite is one such suite that competes very well with Photoshop and Illustrator. It helps you with image editing, digital painting, Web graphics, animation, and vector drawing.

For example, the two latest Windows operating systems, 7 and 8 , have kept user-favorite features while upgrading other content. Windows 7 has been a popular Windows OS due to its intuitive design, which is much more user-friendly than that of previous generations. On-screen navigation has been simplified with a larger, customizable taskbar, so popular applications can be opened with only a single click. While there are many versions of Windows 7, Ultimate offers increased security and data backup. The OS comes with BitLocker, a hard drive encryption program. Windows 7 Professional offers advanced storage, as well, which prevents unsaved documents from being lost during hardware malfunctions. Windows 8 is the latest version of Microsoft's flagship operating system. The platform features interfaces that have been optimized for mobile and desktop computing, though both menus can be used easily on computers and tablets. Users don't have to buy new laptops to use Windows 8, because multiple versions of the OS are available. Windows 8 is the basic OS upgrade, providing users with new features such as the tiled start screen and downloadable apps from the Windows Store. Windows 8 Pro includes BitLocker and remote desktop sharing, making it the optimal choice for professionals who need to use their home computer for work.", "parent_text": "Software", "keyword_density": {"windows": "3.9", "windows os": "0.7", "os": "3.2"}, "department_id": 5},

Small business owners can make sure their staff has access to all the right equipment so their jobs are done well. For basic office functions there are standard document creation programs - including ones for text, spreadsheets and schedules. A company may work more efficiently if employees have familiar software available, instead of learning how to use an entirely new set of tools and features. If you want to focus on growing your business' online presence, there are programs available for website design. Pages can be created on site by your own employees, instead of outsourcing the project to a potentially expensive web developer. You'll also have better control over what content is available on your website due to such new software. Other programs are designed to make financial tasks easier and less time consuming. Currently, finance software titles that can handle everything from taxes to payroll and expenses to revenue are available. Finance software makes it possible for a business to perform its own bookkeeping and eliminates the need to hire outside consultants. Make sure you buy software that's compatible with all your computers' OS's. Many programs that work on a Windows-based PC won't work on a Mac and vice versa. This can also be a problem when trying to share documents - sometimes the formats aren't compatible from one OS to another, making files inaccessible to employees operating on different systems.

If you're looking for flexibility, portability and quality, chances are you're going to want to get a cordless phone. Cordless phones can be set up in any room of the house, and the independent handset can be carried from one room to the next. Depending on the signal strength of the charging stand, you can even take it to a different floor or outside the house without worrying about dropping the call. Unlike with a cell phone or bluetooth device, this can make a cordless phone a more desirable option when you're making calls from home. Furthermore, by ditching the cords and removing the physical tether, you've got the freedom to roam while you talk so you can get things done and not be forced to stay in one place or cut short a conversation. A cordless phone can also have a number of other receivers set up throughout the house. This means that multiple handsets and charging bases can be married to a single main dock - but you can charge them on any available unit. Additionally, you'll never have to worry about running through the house searching for a receiver again - you can sync three or more cordless phone cradles in various rooms of the house and have easy access for incoming or outgoing calls. Finally, because cordless phones use rechargeable batteries in their handsets, you can carry one with you while the others charge so you've always got a reliable phone line at the ready.", "parent_text": "Telephones / VoIP", "keyword_density": {"cordless phones": "1.5", "cordless": "2.2"}, "department_id": 8},

Whether you\u2019re looking to protect your interior or exterior, we have the right style and capabilities for you. Some models even offer the option to record events directly to DVR, ensuring that you\u2019ll always have fast access to the footage you need, especially in the event of an emergency.!

Chances are a security camera is pointed squarely at your face. If anyone was to commit a crime on the premises, police would be able to track that perpetrator down quickly. You can achieve this same level of security at your home or personal business with surveillance cameras. Security cameras don\u2019t have to be the big, bulky models frequently seen in movies. Options range from small and discreet to front-and-center prominence, allowing you to choose how to handle your security. Larger, more obvious surveillance cameras can deter potential troublemakers by their sheer presence, while small cameras can be tucked away to ensure that, no matter what happens, everything is safely recorded. We offer many different styles of security cameras, from dome models that look just like light fixtures to wireless cameras and even those that feature night vision. Whether you\u2019re looking to protect your interior or exterior, we have the right style and capabilities for you. Some models even offer the option to record events directly to DVR, ensuring that you\u2019ll always have fast access to the footage you need, especially in the event of an emergency.!

Warm fronts can sweep through one day, but then later that night you could see record low temperatures. With something as unpredictable as the climate, it's best to be prepared for any possibility. Installing air conditioners can keep any space comfortable, no matter what the conditions are outside. If your home or office is too warm, you'll likely be uncomfortable, and you might be unable to relax because you can't cool down or stop sweating. AC units can regulate the temperature and let you breathe easy. Air conditioners do more than keep a room cool. The machines circulate air and filter out pollutants like smoke, allergens and dust, so the air is cleaner than it would be if you used a fan. This can also help eliminate airborne germs by taking them out of circulation, or at least sending them outside. Some units aren't powerful enough to filter air in multiple rooms, and not every consumer can afford to buy multiple ACs. Portable models or fans can provide the same functionality as those that sit in windows, while being easier to move. Most of these machines have wheels so they can be pushed from room to room with little effort. You can find more air conditioners online than you could in retail outlets. Stores carry limited stock, especially during the cooler months, and as such you won't always find the right model for your needs. Additionally, buying an AC from a digital storefront means the machine will be delivered right to your door so you don't have to carry it from the register to your car to your home. Air conditioners can make your home or office comfortable and cool. Instead of suffering through warmer days, you can enjoy controlled temperatures using your unit.", "parent_text": "A/Cs & Fans", "keyword_density": {"air conditioners": "2.6", "air": "2.6"}, "department_id": 8},

It's inefficient for employees to manually enter every Universal Product Code (UPC). If customers have large purchase orders, it may take awhile for those transactions to be completed. Barcode scanners can simplify the entire process and save time during checkouts. These devices read barcodes and enter the product information directly to your registers. Employees simply wave the readers over items to check the prices. Every POS terminal is different and there are various scanner models for every system. USB barcode scanners can be used with almost every register. As long you have an available USB port you can sync the reader to your system and start ringing items. Employees shouldn't struggle with their hardware. Small problems can cause delays that frustrate customers who are tired of waiting. If a scanner's cord is tangled, associates have to stop helping patrons and untie the knots. Wireless barcode scanners are easy to use and don't require any additional steps to sync with POS terminals. Scanners have many advantages over entering prices or UPCs for every purchase. For example, if your employees manually enter item totals, there's no way to track inventory. Barcode scanners can help connect your registers to your stockroom so you can monitor which products are selling quickly and should be restocked soon. Barcode readers also help employees complete more transactions. Associates only need to press a button to scan an item through. Additionally, workers can interact with patrons and deliver stronger customer service because staffers don't have to read long codes and type them repeatedly.", "parent_text": "Point of Sale", "keyword_density": {"barcode scanners": "2.8", "barcode": "2.1", "scanners": "1.7"}, "department_id": 11},

Warm fronts can sweep through one day, but then later that night you could see record low temperatures. With something as unpredictable as the climate, it's best to be prepared for any possibility. Installing air conditioners can keep any space comfortable, no matter what the conditions are outside. If your home or office is too warm, you'll likely be uncomfortable, and you might be unable to relax because you can't cool down or stop sweating. AC units can regulate the temperature and let you breathe easy. Air conditioners do more than keep a room cool. The machines circulate air and filter out pollutants like smoke, allergens and dust, so the air is cleaner than it would be if you used a fan. This can also help eliminate airborne germs by taking them out of circulation, or at least sending them outside. Some units aren't powerful enough to filter air in multiple rooms, and not every consumer can afford to buy multiple ACs. Portable models or fans can provide the same functionality as those that sit in windows, while being easier to move. Most of these machines have wheels so they can be pushed from room to room with little effort. You can find more air conditioners online than you could in retail outlets. Stores carry limited stock, especially during the cooler months, and as such you won't always find the right model for your needs. Additionally, buying an AC from a digital storefront means the machine will be delivered right to your door so you don't have to carry it from the register to your car to your home. Air conditioners can make your home or office comfortable and cool. Instead of suffering through warmer days, you can enjoy controlled temperatures using your unit.", "parent_text": "A/Cs & Fans", "keyword_density": {"air conditioners": "2.6", "air": "2.6"}, "department_id": 8},

Whether you need speakers for the outdoors, a television room, or to hear your stereo throughout the house, you can find great audio equipment in our online catalog. As with all of our home electronics, our speakers are not only state of the art but also well-priced. You will not find superior value anywhere on the Internet. How to Choose Speakers The key to choosing the right speakers is understanding what the specifications mean. The most basic detail is the configuration, which is expressed as 2.0, 2.1, 4.1, and so on. The first digit refers to how many speakers come with the set, and the numeral to the right of the decimal point refers to how many subwoofers come with the system. A subwoofer provides a strong bass that many standard speakers are incapable of playing. Another factor to consider is sensitivity, which is measured in decibels (dB). Highly sensitive speakers (anything over 92 dB) can produce clear, high-volume sound without much amplifier power. Speakers with less than 88 dB are considered inefficient; sound will be distorted on these speakers without the help of a high-quality amplifier. Frequency response is also important. Ideally, you want speakers that can reproduce the entire spectrum of audible frequencies. The lowest frequency detectable by the human ear is 20 Hz, and the highest is 20,000 Hz, or 20 kHz. If speakers cannot play something as low as 20 Hz, the only way to hear everything you are supposed to hear is by purchasing a subwoofer. What about Watts?Unless you plan on hosting a heavy metal concert in your backyard, you will probably never blow your speakers regardless of the amplifier you use. Distortion causes blown speakers far more often than volume. To avoid blown speakers, never exceed the recommended wattage on your amplifiers. This will prevent distortion. By playing music at a comfortable listening level without distortion, your speakers will be just fine.

If you're looking for flexibility, portability and quality, chances are you're going to want to get a cordless phone. Cordless phones can be set up in any room of the house, and the independent handset can be carried from one room to the next. Depending on the signal strength of the charging stand, you can even take it to a different floor or outside the house without worrying about dropping the call. Unlike with a cell phone or bluetooth device, this can make a cordless phone a more desirable option when you're making calls from home. Furthermore, by ditching the cords and removing the physical tether, you've got the freedom to roam while you talk so you can get things done and not be forced to stay in one place or cut short a conversation. A cordless phone can also have a number of other receivers set up throughout the house. This means that multiple handsets and charging bases can be married to a single main dock - but you can charge them on any available unit. Additionally, you'll never have to worry about running through the house searching for a receiver again - you can sync three or more cordless phone cradles in various rooms of the house and have easy access for incoming or outgoing calls. Finally, because cordless phones use rechargeable batteries in their handsets, you can carry one with you while the others charge so you've always got a reliable phone line at the ready.", "parent_text": "Telephones / VoIP", "keyword_density": {"cordless phones": "1.5", "cordless": "2.2"}, "department_id": 11},

You have a half-dozen computers working together, sending and receiving documents, collaborating on projects, communicating quickly and easily without the interference and lag of a general connection, and you're confident that your network is running properly. Then, you realize that you have to print something. Getting printers set up and accessible within a network structure can be frustrating, especially when working with remote servers and accessing machines, but print servers can assist with getting these devices working more quickly. Whether wired or wireless, these devices plug in to printer network connection ports, granting usage for authorized users and those within the system. As not every manufacturer makes printers compatible with every kind of network or every other print device on the market, a print server can override this incompatibility, making a device usable as long as it has the right adapter. It's also great for offices with multiple printers. A network can host so many machines that it's cumbersome to have all print jobs routed to the same printer, especially when a device is built to handle multiple functions. A printer can also be a scanner, copier and fax machine, making it necessary to have more than one machine to fit unit-task needs, so routing them all into a single client can make it easy for users in a vast network to select a device that's not busy. This also helps when one of these printers inevitably gets jammed. Print servers hook devices into a network in a way that makes them most useful to the greatest number of users. These devices are affordable and easy to install, increase the productivity and flexibility of those working with them and can help make an office a much saner place to work.", "parent_text": "Printers / Scanners & Supplies", "keyword_density": {"printer": "2.2", "servers": "0.9"}, "department_id": 1},

Features and Applications of Our Fax Machines Scanning and printing capabilities are two of the most important aspects of any fax machine, photo copier, or printer. If you prefer to have the capability to send and receive color documents, there are plenty of color fax machines in our online catalog. Surprisingly, color fax machines are not much more expensive than black-and-white-only machines. Modem speed is probably the most important thing you will look for in a fax machine. The slower the speed the lower the amount of pages you can transmit in a minute. Most fax machines today are in the 14.4Kbps or 33.6Kbs ranges and perform quite quick with transmission speeds between 6 seconds (slower models) and 2 seconds (faster models) per page.

It's inefficient for employees to manually enter every Universal Product Code (UPC). If customers have large purchase orders, it may take awhile for those transactions to be completed. Barcode scanners can simplify the entire process and save time during checkouts. These devices read barcodes and enter the product information directly to your registers. Employees simply wave the readers over items to check the prices. Every POS terminal is different and there are various scanner models for every system. USB barcode scanners can be used with almost every register. As long you have an available USB port you can sync the reader to your system and start ringing items. Employees shouldn't struggle with their hardware. Small problems can cause delays that frustrate customers who are tired of waiting. If a scanner's cord is tangled, associates have to stop helping patrons and untie the knots. Wireless barcode scanners are easy to use and don't require any additional steps to sync with POS terminals. Scanners have many advantages over entering prices or UPCs for every purchase. For example, if your employees manually enter item totals, there's no way to track inventory. Barcode scanners can help connect your registers to your stockroom so you can monitor which products are selling quickly and should be restocked soon. Barcode readers also help employees complete more transactions. Associates only need to press a button to scan an item through. Additionally, workers can interact with patrons and deliver stronger customer service because staffers don't have to read long codes and type them repeatedly.", "parent_text": "Printers / Scanners & Supplies", "keyword_density": {"barcode scanners": "2.8", "barcode": "2.1", "scanners": "1.7"}, "department_id": 1},

The machines require constant care and maintenance to function properly, and even the most vigilant users can run into problems. Electrical issues can be devastating - whether it's a power outage that causes work to be lost, a blown fuse that shuts the system down or anything in between. An uninterrupted power supply prevents disruptions from electrical malfunctions. While the devices don't hold a long-lasting charge, users will have enough time to save files and properly turn off a computer to avoid any damage or find and activate an alternate power source. Unlike a generator, there is no lag time between a loss of power and activation with UPS power supplies. The back-ups store electricity that is immediately shared with any connected computer when primary power is lost. This prevents system damage by avoiding sudden changes in voltage. Hard drives can be damaged by electrical losses and surges. UPS battery backups maintain a steady rate of power for a computer and can extend the life of any piece of equipment by eliminating the long-term harm electrical fluctuations can cause. Shoppers should consider their needs when researching a UPS device. Some back-up systems last longer than others, which would be better for users who don't have an alternate power source available. Consumers who have a secondary electrical supply should buy a device that lasts long enough to activate the other power source. If you're worried about the longevity of the UPS, there are models with screens and diagnostic tools. You'll be able to monitor the health of the device and avoid wearing the system out by overloading it.

In older hard drives, controllers were separate boards. With a typical IDE hard drive, you can have up to four devices directly connected to the motherboard. An example would be the hard drive, floppy drive, CD-ROM, and DVD drives. If all the spots are used up, you would need to purchase another hard drive controller card. Sometimes the hard drive controller can fail and you will need to replace it. You need the same type of controller as your hard drive. For example, IDE drives are only compatible with IDE controllers, and SCSI drives need SCSI controllers. Hard Drive Controller Errors If you get an error that says \"HDD controller failure\" upon booting your computer, it usually means the hard disk drive (HDD) controller has failed. Sometimes, you will get a 1701 error, which means the hard drive controller and the drive are having trouble communicating. This might be due to a loose connection. The best way to avoid losing data is to prevent loss by backing up. With the low cost of external hard drives this is a ideal solution.

All those threats. All those data security issues. You want the cloud, but you're afraid of DropBox, and that's understandable, but you want your own cloud. In a world where we can have everything customized, from our electronics to our cars, pets, homes, clothes and our own bodies, there's no reason you can't have a storage solution that's as cheap, effective and accessible as the cloud without worrying about someone else's terms of service or use agreements. That's why network attached storage is such a handy product for those in the know. Network-attached storage (NAS) is data storage or a data storage device, such as a hard drive or RAID array, connected to a computer network, providing data access to different network clients. When you have a few computers working in tandem, it's essential that they have access to the same collaborative tools and files necessary to get projects completed. An enterprise-level solution like NAS gives all these machines access to the same documents whenever they need, so long as they can access the network. Wired or wireless options are possible with network attached storage. Wi-Fi capable, internet-ready and able to house a few disks worth of data (which you'll likely have to buy separately), these can be isolated from the online world if you so choose, or made accessible if you see fit. They allow not only sharing of key information but also devices like scanners, printers and fax machines. NAS Systems NAS systems contain one or more hard disks, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID arrays (redundant arrays of inexpensive/independent disks). NAS devices remove the responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network. NAS provides both storage and file systems. This is often contrasted with SAN (Storage Area Network) devices, which provide only block-based storage and leaves filesystem concerns on the \"client\" side. SAN protocols include SCSI, Fibre Channel, iSCSI, ATA over Ethernet, or HyperSCSI. Flexibility & Scalability Fit for personal or small business use, network attached storage is flexible, scalable and ready for whatever in-house storage and devices you can throw at it. Reasonably priced, they even outmatch some online vendor contracts and can outlast an outage, too.

Employees simply wave the readers over items to check the prices. Every POS terminal is different and there are various scanner models for every system.

Wireless barcode scanners are easy to use and don't require any additional steps to sync with POS terminals. Scanners have many advantages over entering prices or UPCs for every purchase. For example, if your employees manually enter item totals, there's no way to track inventory. Barcode scanners can help connect your registers to your stockroom so you can monitor which products are selling quickly and should be restocked soon.

All the equipment needs to be compatible to give an audience the best viewing experience. Due to strides in technology, audio devices can make movies and television shows sound crystal clear, but a standard high-definition television's picture might lag behind a sound system's performance. Buying the best home theater projector could level the playing field. If you're going to be watching a great deal of programming, a projector might be easier on the eyes than an LCD or LED television. The devices are backlit to create a sharper image on screen, while sending light directly into your vision. This is what usually causes eye strain after watching for an extended period of time. Projectors are only directing light toward the screen, making it more comfortable to enjoy a movie marathon. There is more flexibility with a home theater projector, as well. Instead of having a television with a set size, a projector can be adjusted to fill bigger and smaller display areas. Moving the device further away from the screen creates a bigger image, while moving it closer shrinks it. This is a convenient adjustment for users who want to use their device in more than one room. It is important to note the minimum and maximum size settings on each projector, because picture quality will deteriorate if moved beyond those thresholds. You may want to consider the lamp life of a projector before making a purchase. Light bulbs don't last forever, so at some point you'll need to replace one in your device. Most projectors offer settings designed to lengthen a bulb's life, but these options may reduce viewing quality while cutting down on power consumption. It's important to consider all your needs before buying a home theater projector. Make sure you have figured out what you expect from the device and what you'll use it for, so you can buy the best one for your home theater.", "parent_text": "Projectors", "keyword_density": {"home theater": "3.0", "projectors": "0.6"}, "department_id": 1},

However, not all PCs come equipped with sound cards that can produce the type of audio you want. If you use a computer as a home theater, music player, or gaming system, it is ideal to have the capability for 5.1 surround sound. 5.1 means there are five speakers and one subwoofer. Sound cards send different audio signals to each of the five speakers, so the speakers all play a different portion of the overall sound. Rather than simply hearing the audio from a computer, a listener becomes immersed in whatever is playing. This intensifies the video gaming experience and enhances your enjoyment of music and movies. Sound Card Features to Look for If you plan on using a computer to record or play music, consider purchasing a sound card with MIDI. MIDI is a standard for connecting electronic musical instruments. Having MIDI is especially helpful to musicians who like to write and record their own songs. With the right software programs and a sound card with MIDI, it is possible for one musician to play five different instruments (one at a time) and then overlap the recordings together to make one song on the computer. Other important sound card specifications include whether or not the card has a microphone plug, and the operating systems that can read the card. It is especially important to check this latter detail if you are using an older operating system. Some of the newer sound cards only work with newer operating systems.

To get the best possible performance for streaming movies and video playback, as well as in-game audio experiences, it's essential that you get the best computer speakers to round out your machine. A standard set of side-by-side speakers will let you hear what's happening more clearly than using an onboard sound device. Without a tool like this, you may not get any audio with your playback at all, so this should be considered a basic purchase to go along with upgrading a keyboard and mouse. If you want a real experience with your media, try purchasing a heftier system. Something with a subwoofer and additional high-powered speakers can make it feel like you have a surround sound experience in your computer chair. Purchasing a speaker system also means considering how these will be connected. Some systems have USB hook-ups or other plugs and cables that won't require as many dedicated sockets, but there are expanders and other solutions to increase the maximum number of USB devices you can have going at once. Some devices will also be able to pull power right from the computer they're attached to, but in some cases they have a dedicated power supply that will need its own wall outlet. You may need to buy a separate power strip on top of speakers to make sure the entire system will function correctly. Buying the best computer speakers will ensure high-quality gaming and viewing from your machine.

Nobody wants to mess around with desk microphones with unnecessary feedback or large computer speakers that garble in-game music and distort what other players are saying. Serious gaming requires serious headsets, and finding one that works best for you is what raises your in-game performance. Like standard pairs of headphones , headsets have a variety of styles and sizes. Some have bands that go over the top of the head, others wrap behind and still others do away with bands altogether and clip to ears to avoid stressing the temples. A wireless set may be more up a gamer's alley, as these relieve the exasperation a tethered headset can provide. The real added benefit of a headset comes from the onboard microphone, a feature that not all headsets provide but one that's worth looking for. This function gives you the ability to talk and listen without getting excessive feedback from keyboard or electronic activity, as well as reducing the amount of interference on your end so that other people in your conversation can hear you more easily. As any gamer knows, a successful raid relies partly on good communication, so it's essential that everyone in the party knows who you're dotting before someone kites the group. Headsets come in a variety of colors and styles, and picking the right one with the best additional features will depend on your preferences. Noise reducing, wireless or wired, with a slew of different wearing options and the ability to talk more easily while hammering on your keyboard, a headset is an integral part of successful online communication.", "parent_text": "Speakers & Headsets", "keyword_density": {"headsets": "1.4"}, "department_id": 1},

Writing them down on the go can be troublesome, especially if you are in a moving vehicle. Voice recorders are the perfect way to record your brilliant ideas without the need for cassette tapes or writing instruments. You can record memos, business meetings, an audio journal, and your phone conversations with these. Instead of storing the information on tape, the machines store them in digital formats. You can then transfer them to your computer to play them back or archive them, or send the audio files to other people through email. If you only need occasional voice recordings or basic functionality, a PDA or MP3 player with voice recording capability will probably suit your needs. However, if you're someone who needs to record conversations, you're better off with a dedicated digital voice recorder. Browse our site to find a large selection and the lowest prices on digital voice recording devices. While smartphones can do almost everything, their generalized functionality prevents the devices from excelling at some tasks. In addition, they have limited storage, and media files like recordings require large amounts of space. Content can easily be lost amid all of the documents stored on such devices, meaning that valuable information could be all but inaccessible. Additionally, some recorders have over 4GB of memory, meaning they can hold sizable libraries. Digital voice recorders only store audio files and can easily be connected to computers to export all documents. Some of these devices are equipped with built-in USB drives allowing you to easily save your notes once you're done recording. These specific models don't require wires, so they're more convenient to use while on the go. Sometimes you'll need to listen to something immediately, so reliable playback is a necessity. There are recorders with speakers and headphone jacks so you can listen to everything instantly without allowing anyone else to hear. Recorders feature strong battery life, so you never have to worry about them dying at an inopportune time. For instance, if you're recording a lecture, you shouldn't worry that you'll miss the conclusion because of a dead battery. Some audiophiles quickly notice the poor quality, especially in digital devices, and prefer analog gadgets. As an alternative, cassette recorders are also available. Some may argue that tapes are inefficient because they don't have large storage capacities, though tapes can be recycled so you don't have to frequently buy new ones. Whether you need to listen in on a business meeting after its conclusion or take personal notes throughout the day, a voice recorder may be one of the best possible gadgets for your job.", "parent_text": "Office Machines", "keyword_density": {"voice recorders": "0.9", "voice": "1.5", "recorders": "1.3"}, "department_id": 11},

It's inefficient for employees to manually enter every Universal Product Code (UPC). If customers have large purchase orders, it may take awhile for those transactions to be completed. Barcode scanners can simplify the entire process and save time during checkouts. These devices read barcodes and enter the product information directly to your registers. Employees simply wave the readers over items to check the prices. Every POS terminal is different and there are various scanner models for every system. USB barcode scanners can be used with almost every register. As long you have an available USB port you can sync the reader to your system and start ringing items. Employees shouldn't struggle with their hardware. Small problems can cause delays that frustrate customers who are tired of waiting. If a scanner's cord is tangled, associates have to stop helping patrons and untie the knots. Wireless barcode scanners are easy to use and don't require any additional steps to sync with POS terminals. Scanners have many advantages over entering prices or UPCs for every purchase. For example, if your employees manually enter item totals, there's no way to track inventory. Barcode scanners can help connect your registers to your stockroom so you can monitor which products are selling quickly and should be restocked soon. Barcode readers also help employees complete more transactions. Associates only need to press a button to scan an item through. Additionally, workers can interact with patrons and deliver stronger customer service because staffers don't have to read long codes and type them repeatedly.", "parent_text": "Scanners", "keyword_density": {"barcode scanners": "2.8", "barcode": "2.1", "scanners": "1.7"}, "department_id": 11},

Features and Applications of Our Fax Machines Scanning and printing capabilities are two of the most important aspects of any fax machine, photo copier, or printer. If you prefer to have the capability to send and receive color documents, there are plenty of color fax machines in our online catalog. Surprisingly, color fax machines are not much more expensive than black-and-white-only machines. Modem speed is probably the most important thing you will look for in a fax machine. The slower the speed the lower the amount of pages you can transmit in a minute. Most fax machines today are in the 14.4Kbps or 33.6Kbs ranges and perform quite quick with transmission speeds between 6 seconds (slower models) and 2 seconds (faster models) per page.

If you're looking for flexibility, portability and quality, chances are you're going to want to get a cordless phone. Cordless phones can be set up in any room of the house, and the independent handset can be carried from one room to the next. Depending on the signal strength of the charging stand, you can even take it to a different floor or outside the house without worrying about dropping the call. Unlike with a cell phone or bluetooth device, this can make a cordless phone a more desirable option when you're making calls from home. Furthermore, by ditching the cords and removing the physical tether, you've got the freedom to roam while you talk so you can get things done and not be forced to stay in one place or cut short a conversation. A cordless phone can also have a number of other receivers set up throughout the house. This means that multiple handsets and charging bases can be married to a single main dock - but you can charge them on any available unit. Additionally, you'll never have to worry about running through the house searching for a receiver again - you can sync three or more cordless phone cradles in various rooms of the house and have easy access for incoming or outgoing calls. Finally, because cordless phones use rechargeable batteries in their handsets, you can carry one with you while the others charge so you've always got a reliable phone line at the ready.", "parent_text": "Telephones / VoIP", "keyword_density": {"cordless phones": "1.5", "cordless": "2.2"}, "department_id": 11},

Plasma monitors don't come in desktop sizes, and represent higher costs, weight, and energy consumption. Most homes and offices use monitors between 15 to 20 inches, though larger widescreen monitors increase productivity at work and enjoyment of games and movies at home. Newegg carries a huge variety of LCD monitors from Samsung, NEC, ViewSonic, Acer, HP, Hanns-G, ASUS, and many other major brands. Pros and Cons LCD Monitors are thin, lightweight and easy to move, and some are wall-mountable, getting them completely off your desk, providing drastically greater options for work or play. Adjustable monitor stands also offer increased ergonomics. LCD monitors have a steadier, flicker-free picture, causing far less eyestrain, and are a blessing to users who spend long hours at their screens. They use less energy than plasma monitors or CRTs. What should you consider before purchase? LCD monitors are currently available in a variety of screen sizes . A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions, which translate into more on the screen at once. LCD screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Newegg carries LCD monitors from 15\" all the way up to 52\"! Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD monitor can support. A monitor provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 5:4, similar to a standard television set's aspect ratio of 4:3. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD monitor's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD monitor's response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD monitors today can provide over 200 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Viewing angle is the greatest angle (horizontal or vertical) from which a user can view an LCD screen at an acceptable image quality. A wide viewing angle enables a group of people to view the screen at once or enables a user with greater viewing flexibility. LCD monitors are usually equipped with one or two types of connectors for connecting to your PC. D-Sub Connectors transfer analog signals and are still very popular as they are compatible with most video cards. DVI Connectors transfer a video card's digital output directly for a superior signal. The DVI connector is mainstream equipment on newer video cards and on an increasing number of new LCD monitors. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors are necessary for displays with HD resolution approaching that of HDTV, from 720-1080 lines per frame, and they're backwards-compatible with DVI systems.

On it rests the documents you create, the music you listen to, the games you play and the video you view. You'll want to choose a drive which is optimized for your primary purpose. There are a few main things to consider when selecting a hard drive: internal or external hard drive, connection type, speed and capacity. Whether you call it a Hard Drive, a Hard Disk, or an HDD, budget permitting, always go for the fastest drive you can. Speed of data access is measured using RPMs (revolutions per minute). Typical drives range from 5400 to 7200 RPM, with more and more 9600 RPM drive appearing on the scene. A faster rotational speed means greater performance, especially in games, but may cause greater heat and noise. The capacity, measured in GB (gigabytes), should depend on your own storage requirements. A higher capacity drive will invariably cost more than a smaller drive, so a balance must usually be struck between capacity and cost. The hard drive interface, whether it's IDE, SATA, or SCSI determine a drive's application: IDE and SATA for personal storage and SCSI for enterprise and mission critical storage. Please see our Internal Hard Drive Buying Guide for more information. ATA/IDE Whether you call it \"Advanced Technology Attachment\" or \"Integrated Drive Electronics\", the name given to it by Western Digital, this connection method has the drive controller integrated into the drive, rather than connected to the motherboard. They can communicate at up to 133 MB/s. SATA 1.5 Gbit/s First-generation SATA interfaces, also known as SATA/150 or unofficially as SATA 1, communicate at a rate of 150MB/s or 1.5 Gbit/s. SATA 3.0 Gbit/s Soon after SATA 1.5 Gbit/s introduction a number of shortcomings were observed. This feature, Native Command Queuing (NCQ), was adopted as an optional supported feature for SATA 1.5 Gbit/s and SATA 3.0 Gbit/s devices. SATA 3.0 Gbit/s is designed to fall back to SATA 1.5 Gbit/s when in communication with these older devices. In practice, some older SATA controllers do not properly implement SATA speed negotiation. SATA cables are less expensive and more compact than for ATA. With the introduction of SATA, convention ATA is sometimes called Parallel ATA (PATA), which refers to the method in which the data travels over the wires. SATA 6.0 Gbit/s Over the years the industry has increased bus bandwidth from PATA through SATA 1.5 Gb/s and SATA 3 Gb/s to keep up with the demand for higher transfer rates. The next evolution of bus bandwidth has now been achieved with the introduction of SATA 6 Gb/s, (SATA 3.0). This transition to a SATA 6 Gb/s interface aligns with the introduction of SATA 6 Gb/s-supporting chip sets and motherboards coming to the market. SAS - Serial attached SCSI Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a computer bus used to move data to and from computer storage devices such as hard drives and tape drives. SAS depends on a point-to-point serial protocol that replaces the parallel SCSI bus technology that first appeared in the mid 1980s in data centers and workstations, and it uses the standard SCSI command set. SAS offers backwards-compatibility with second-generation SATA drives. SATA 3 Gbit/s drives may be connected to SAS backplanes, but SAS drives may not be connected to SATA backplanes. Cables and Connectors for SATA Devices Connectors and Cables are the same for either generation. They are used on 3.5-in SATA hard disks for desktop and server computers and 2.5-in disks for laptop or small computers. SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) Actually a variety of interfaces ranging from Narrow SCSI at 40Mb/s to Ultra-640 SCSI at 5120Mb/s may be substantially more expensive than other connections, but it offers a wider range of connection and device possibilities. Frequently SCSI connections may be found in higher-speed disks, up to 15000 RPM.", "parent_text": "Computer Hardware", "keyword_density": {"hard": "1.3", "drives": "1.0", "hard drives": "0.6"}, "department_id": 1},

The most basic webcams are intended for internet chat use and give viewers a good picture of the person sitting at the computer. High-level webcams, on the other hand, produce fluid streaming video and can be used for business conferences, surveillance, and home security. Reading the Specifications of Webcams Available at Newegg One of the most telling specifications of any webcam is the frame rate. This measures how many frames the camera captures every second. When a camera records just one frame per second (fps), the video appears very choppy. You will see very little correspondence between the person's mouth and the words he or she is speaking. A webcam with a frame rate of 30 fps, on the other hand, will produce video almost as fluid as a television broadcast. Another important measurement is effective pixels. The more effective pixels your web cam has, the clearer the image will be. The most basic webcams produce good images, but viewers may not be able to discern certain details. Features that should appear curved may look rectangular. 1.3 MP or more of effective pixels is ideal however lower amounts of pixels will work for most general purposes.", "parent_text": "Input Devices", "keyword_density": {"webcams": "2.3"}, "department_id": 1},

The machines require constant care and maintenance to function properly, and even the most vigilant users can run into problems. Electrical issues can be devastating - whether it's a power outage that causes work to be lost, a blown fuse that shuts the system down or anything in between. An uninterrupted power supply prevents disruptions from electrical malfunctions. While the devices don't hold a long-lasting charge, users will have enough time to save files and properly turn off a computer to avoid any damage or find and activate an alternate power source. Unlike a generator, there is no lag time between a loss of power and activation with UPS power supplies. The back-ups store electricity that is immediately shared with any connected computer when primary power is lost. This prevents system damage by avoiding sudden changes in voltage. Hard drives can be damaged by electrical losses and surges. UPS battery backups maintain a steady rate of power for a computer and can extend the life of any piece of equipment by eliminating the long-term harm electrical fluctuations can cause. Shoppers should consider their needs when researching a UPS device. Some back-up systems last longer than others, which would be better for users who don't have an alternate power source available. Consumers who have a secondary electrical supply should buy a device that lasts long enough to activate the other power source. If you're worried about the longevity of the UPS, there are models with screens and diagnostic tools. You'll be able to monitor the health of the device and avoid wearing the system out by overloading it.

It can put data at risk - not just from hackers or spammers or nosey bosses, but with some providers offering shady terms, you could lose the intellectual rights to anything uploaded. Having a portable memory drive means you don't have to sacrifice mobility for security, though, making flash drives an ideal solution for business people on the go. These are great to have when traveling abroad, too. If you should happen to need a secure link to personal data, are operating outside your network range or should lose your valuables, you can keep a flash drive handy containing ID and serial numbers for personal devices. To ensure this information isn't stolen as well, having a locked flash drive can keep anyone from viewing your files should the drive fall into the wrong hands. Tiny and portable, they easily slip into a pants or coat pocket, in a computer bag or purse, and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. External keypads add an additional level of security to portable memory, meaning a viewer must first input a numerical code to gain access to files. These in turn can be encrypted and password protected, deterring serious threats to personal security. Flash drives are also cost-effective. You can securely store a few dozen gigabytes of data for less than $30, and these devices range in storage capacity, price and overall size - equal to the amount you're willing to invest. Some even have special features like lanyards, locks, belt clips and key fobs to make them easier to carry and keep track of. Having a way to handle and maintain personal information is essential in a digital age, but not everyone wants the world to be privy to their data.

This makes it ideal for devices such as digital cameras where batteries go dead often. With being able to retain data even when power is lost you can rest assured that all your pictures will still be kept safe on the memory card. Examples of flash memory cards include Secure Digital (SD) memory cards, Compact Flash (CF) memory cards, and Sony's Memory Sticks (MS, M2, MS Duo, MS Pro, and MS Pro Duo) to name a few. Other examples of proprietary and permanent flash memory devices include memory cards for video gaming systems. The Benefits of Flash Memory Flash memory is extremely small, fast, lightweight, and makes no noise or have any moving parts, unlike hard drives. However, hard disks can hold considerably more data and its cost per megabyte is much cheaper although prices are quickly dropping as capacity grows larger for flash devices daily. Yet flash memory is quite reliable and allows you to specify which data you want to keep. USB flash drives are known as the floppy disks of the 21st century. You can see people walking around with them dangling from key chains, backpacks, and even around their necks. These are more resistant to physical abuse than the media cards used in digital cameras. They're also an improvement over optical storage like CDs and DVDs, which are easily scratched. Prices of the drives have come down so much that many companies give them to clients instead of printing reports and wasting paper and ink. In some schools, students are required to have them.

However, not all PCs come equipped with sound cards that can produce the type of audio you want. If you use a computer as a home theater, music player, or gaming system, it is ideal to have the capability for 5.1 surround sound. 5.1 means there are five speakers and one subwoofer. Sound cards send different audio signals to each of the five speakers, so the speakers all play a different portion of the overall sound. Rather than simply hearing the audio from a computer, a listener becomes immersed in whatever is playing. This intensifies the video gaming experience and enhances your enjoyment of music and movies. Sound Card Features to Look for If you plan on using a computer to record or play music, consider purchasing a sound card with MIDI. MIDI is a standard for connecting electronic musical instruments. Having MIDI is especially helpful to musicians who like to write and record their own songs. With the right software programs and a sound card with MIDI, it is possible for one musician to play five different instruments (one at a time) and then overlap the recordings together to make one song on the computer. Other important sound card specifications include whether or not the card has a microphone plug, and the operating systems that can read the card. It is especially important to check this latter detail if you are using an older operating system. Some of the newer sound cards only work with newer operating systems. Here at Newegg, we have dozens of sound cards that can transform your computer into a state-of-the-art stereo system.

Shoppers can find and choose the right Mac hard drive by thinking about storage and portability needs. To figure out what size hard drive you should buy, think about how much computing you do each day and how many files you save. If you're a heavy user, consider buying a drive with terabytes (TB) of available storage. You'll be able to save an entire system to a device with that much room, so if you need a new computer, you will be able to reinstall everything as it was previously. These units are beneficial to people who work in creative industries and have libraries that are too expansive for a single Mac external hard drive. For example, a photographer who has hundreds of thousands of pictures saved on his or her desktop won't be able to back everything up with a smaller unit. Casual consumers should consider drives with a few hundred gigabytes (GB) of space. Buying a device with TBs of data storage would result in a great deal of wasted space for users who only have a couple thousand files that need to be saved. If you plan on bringing your external Mac hard drive everywhere you go, you'll want to purchase a unit that is light and damage-resistant. Some drives are smaller than most tablets, while other devices are large enough to be confused with video game consoles. If you're prone to damaging your gadgets, consider a drive with pads and shock protectors to defend against significant bumps and bruises.

The hard drive is the epicenter of the computer, providing processing power and storage for the people who use them. Simply put, computing as we know it would be impossible without them. But, like all hardware that has moving parts, hard drives can wear down with time and become unusable. When this occurs, replacement is necessary. It may also be that the hard drive that came standard with a new PC . just is not doing the job it needs to and requires an upgrade. Internal hard drives are available for purchase that can fit any need or desire, be it better graphics or a total system overhaul. In order to maximize computer performance, hard drives should be periodically evaluated in terms of user satisfaction and physical condition. Options of internal hard drive There are countless options when seeking out a new internal hard drive. Newegg has a large selection of products that will meet your needs. Many of the usual big names like HP , Lenovo , Toshiba , ASUS and Dell all have entries in the market. Western Digital and Seagate are also very popular brands of internal hard drive, including popular models such as WD Velociraptor and the Seagate Terascale Hard Drive. Lifespan of a hard drive The reality of technology is that all hardware has an expiration date, and hard drives are no exception. Generally speaking, if a hard drive is in constant use, then the three or four year mark is generally where device failure will start to crop up. There is some debate regarding this, as drives running for as long as eight years have been reported to still function effectively. That all being said, if a computer is put to use long enough, then there will definitely come a time when it needs to be replaced. This is all dependent, however, on what it is used for and how frequently it is put to work. Putting old hard drives to good use In many situations, however, hard drives need only be replaced because they are insufficient for what they are needed for. These old drives might still be in perfect working order, but something else is required for optimal performance. If a desktop computer has an extra drive bay, the new hard drive can be installed to work in tandem with the old one, providing a little extra storage space or performance power. For the laptop users or even the more DIY-minded, old internal hard drives can even be converted into external storage with the installation of a USB enclosure. If there is no extra space, these still-useful devices can be donated to schools or non-profits that might be able to use them. It is advised that a full, comprehensive wipe of the hard drive is performed before being handed over to someone else, however. After all, nobody wants their bank information to inadvertently end up somewhere that it is not supposed to.", "parent_text": "Hard Drives", "keyword_density": {"internal hard drive": "2.9", "hard": "3.9", "drive": "4.1", "hard drive": "7.0"}, "department_id": 1},

They are the circuitry involved in running hard disks and getting them to do what they are supposed to. On IDE drives, the hard drive controller is actually part of the drive. In older hard drives, controllers were separate boards. With a typical IDE hard drive, you can have up to four devices directly connected to the motherboard. An example would be the hard drive, floppy drive, CD-ROM, and DVD drives. If all the spots are used up, you would need to purchase another hard drive controller card. Sometimes the hard drive controller can fail and you will need to replace it. You need the same type of controller as your hard drive. For example, IDE drives are only compatible with IDE controllers, and SCSI drives need SCSI controllers. Hard Drive Controller Errors If you get an error that says \"HDD controller failure\" upon booting your computer, it usually means the hard disk drive (HDD) controller has failed. Sometimes, you will get a 1701 error, which means the hard drive controller and the drive are having trouble communicating. This might be due to a loose connection. The best way to avoid losing data is to prevent loss by backing up. With the low cost of external hard drives this is a ideal solution. By making regular copies of your important files, or by cloning your entire hard drive setup, you'll save yourself a ton of trouble in the event that your hard drive ever goes bad.

In a world where we can have everything customized, from our electronics to our cars, pets, homes, clothes and our own bodies, there's no reason you can't have a storage solution that's as cheap, effective and accessible as the cloud without worrying about someone else's terms of service or use agreements. That's why network attached storage is such a handy product for those in the know. Network-attached storage (NAS) is data storage or a data storage device, such as a hard drive or RAID array, connected to a computer network, providing data access to different network clients. When you have a few computers working in tandem, it's essential that they have access to the same collaborative tools and files necessary to get projects completed. An enterprise-level solution like NAS gives all these machines access to the same documents whenever they need, so long as they can access the network. Wired or wireless options are possible with network attached storage. Wi-Fi capable, internet-ready and able to house a few disks worth of data (which you'll likely have to buy separately), these can be isolated from the online world if you so choose, or made accessible if you see fit. They allow not only sharing of key information but also devices like scanners, printers and fax machines. NAS Systems NAS systems contain one or more hard disks, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID arrays (redundant arrays of inexpensive/independent disks). NAS devices remove the responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network. NAS provides both storage and file systems. This is often contrasted with SAN (Storage Area Network) devices, which provide only block-based storage and leaves filesystem concerns on the \"client\" side. SAN protocols include SCSI, Fibre Channel, iSCSI, ATA over Ethernet, or HyperSCSI. Flexibility & Scalability Fit for personal or small business use, network attached storage is flexible, scalable and ready for whatever in-house storage and devices you can throw at it. Reasonably priced, they even outmatch some online vendor contracts and can outlast an outage, too. Newegg has Network storage / NAS from the world\u2019s best Network storage / NAS manufacturers, including Buffalo, Cavalry, D-Link, Hammer Storage, Intel, iomega, LaCie, Linksys, Maxtor, Netgear, QNAP, Thecus, Western Digital and Synology.", "parent_text": "Hard Drives", "keyword_density": {"network": "2.6", "network attached storage": "2.8", "storage nas": "1.4", "storage": "3.5", "nas": "1.9", "network attached storage nas": "0.9"}, "department_id": 1},

Unfortunately, not every computer's keyboard is comfortable and sturdy. Without these two characteristics, productivity may decline as working becomes a hassle and can even be painful. You may believe that your typing technique requires improvement, but more often than not faulty hardware is the root of your discomfort. Not every model has wrist supports and you can hurt your arms while you type without assistance. Ergonomic keyboards are designed to help you use your computer without any pain. These models have larger bases, letting you rest your wrists and palms while typing. Instead of uncomfortably hovering over your keyboard, your hands have the necessary support to prevent any strain and reduce the likelihood of developing physical ailments like carpal tunnel syndrome. Pads are commonly found on gaming keyboards as those are meant for more casual use. During a marathon game session, players must usually enter a great deal of key commands. With a standard keyboard, this can lead to pain or discomfort, as their hands continually move without support or rest. Some gaming models, by contrast, have features that can improve a gamer's performance as well. Wireless keyboards are also available - these ensure that users aren't tethered to their desks. If you have a large enough screen, you can use your device while sitting away from your computer. Working without wires also allows you to find a relaxed position, so you aren't confined to a single table. Buying a new keyboard can improve your typing proficiency, whether you're writing a term paper or playing a video game. The right device can raise your comfort levels while also making it easier to use your computer through key commands.

Users can leave all their peripherals attached to the hub for more convenient connection and detachment. Instead of unplugging multiple items, consumers only have to remove a USB hub's plug. This is perfect for those who need their computers to travel, such as college students who bring their notebooks to class or workers who need their laptops in the office. There are different styles of plugs to meet the needs of every shopper. Some ports are large and have over 10 USB slots so they might be best utilized in a stationary environment, while others only feature a couple of access points for more mobile use. Other network hubs are just a series of wires so consumers don't have to carry a bulky device. Peripheral accessories help users enjoy their laptops' best features. A USB hub can provide the additional support necessary so that no one ever has to choose which device to use with which program.", "parent_text": "Input Devices", "keyword_density": {"hubs": "0.3", "usb": "2.2"}, "department_id": 1},

Nobody wants to mess around with desk microphones with unnecessary feedback or large computer speakers that garble in-game music and distort what other players are saying. Serious gaming requires serious headsets, and finding one that works best for you is what raises your in-game performance. Like standard pairs of headphones , headsets have a variety of styles and sizes. Some have bands that go over the top of the head, others wrap behind and still others do away with bands altogether and clip to ears to avoid stressing the temples. A wireless set may be more up a gamer's alley, as these relieve the exasperation a tethered headset can provide. The real added benefit of a headset comes from the onboard microphone, a feature that not all headsets provide but one that's worth looking for. This function gives you the ability to talk and listen without getting excessive feedback from keyboard or electronic activity, as well as reducing the amount of interference on your end so that other people in your conversation can hear you more easily. As any gamer knows, a successful raid relies partly on good communication, so it's essential that everyone in the party knows who you're dotting before someone kites the group. Headsets come in a variety of colors and styles, and picking the right one with the best additional features will depend on your preferences. Noise reducing, wireless or wired, with a slew of different wearing options and the ability to talk more easily while hammering on your keyboard, a headset is an integral part of successful online communication.", "parent_text": "Input Devices", "keyword_density": {"headsets": "1.4"}, "department_id": 1},

KVM stands for keyboard, video, mouse. The keyboard, video, and mouse set collectively is called a \"console.\" KVM switches allow you to connect a console to more than one computer. You simply connect your console cables to the output jacks of the switch and connect the switch to the connections on your computer that the keyboard mouse and monitor would normally be plugged into. It's that simple. KVM Switches Let You Switch between Consoles To switch consoles, you just push a button on the switch and it allows you to use the other console. KVM switches save you money because you won't have to purchase separate keyboards, mice, and monitors for each computer you use. It makes it very easy when one person uses more than one computer at work, for example. They are also useful for server farms with one staff person accessing each computer periodically, one at a time.

For artists and graphic designers, a drawing tablet might be the best option. These devices are basically digital sketchbooks. Instead of drawing a design or an image and then recreating it on a laptop, a graphics tablet comes equipped with software so users can create their artwork, save it and share the file with other devices via an internet or wired connection. There are pen tablets available for designers who aren't quite ready to make the leap to touchscreen technology. Most of these devices' screens are sensitive enough that they'll respond to the pen in natural way to create different shades, styles and lines. If you aren't comfortable with the pen that a tablet came packaged with, there are other peripherals available. You can shop around until you find the pen that feels most comfortable in your hand. There are replacement parts available for some pens, which could be useful if you're worried that you'll quickly wear out your drawing tool. Consumers who don't want to untangle wires every time they need to share a new file with another device should consider buying a wireless connection kit. A USB wireless connector enables sharing with any PC, even if the design tablet was not built with wireless sharing. Don't forget to buy a carrying case, so your device is well-protected during transport.

Shoppers can find and choose the right Mac hard drive by thinking about storage and portability needs. To figure out what size hard drive you should buy, think about how much computing you do each day and how many files you save. If you're a heavy user, consider buying a drive with terabytes (TB) of available storage. You'll be able to save an entire system to a device with that much room, so if you need a new computer, you will be able to reinstall everything as it was previously.

For example, a photographer who has hundreds of thousands of pictures saved on his or her desktop won't be able to back everything up with a smaller unit. Casual consumers should consider drives with a few hundred gigabytes (GB) of space. Buying a device with TBs of data storage would result in a great deal of wasted space for users who only have a couple thousand files that need to be saved. If you plan on bringing your external Mac hard drive everywhere you go, you'll want to purchase a unit that is light and damage-resistant. Some drives are smaller than most tablets, while other devices are large enough to be confused with video game consoles.

The units hold data and spin when users access their content. This process requires a great deal of electricity to function properly, which can cause a delay in the speed with which information is displayed on-screen. Solid state drives (SSDs) are becoming a popular alternative to the factory-installed drives. SSDs resemble HDDs on the outside, but their internal processes don't have much in common. The newer drives don't have any moving parts - unlike hard drives that have two magnetic, spinning plates. There are two key advantages to this structural design - it requires less power and provides faster access to saved data. Because files can be read straight from the SSDs, laptops are able to boot up without delay. Users have individual storage needs, so some might not find one SSD as useful as others. There are some drives with only 32 gigabytes (GB) of space, which may be enough for casual use but not enough to save large libraries or backup entire systems. Luckily, there are SSD deals available for every size unit from various manufacturers. This makes it simple to find the correct piece of equipment for every PC, as the two devices must be compatible to work properly. Some universal drives have brackets allowing them to be installed into various pieces of hardware, regardless of system specifications. Users should be sure they know how to install an SSD before making their purchase. Some drives come bundled with instructional DVDs and manuals that guide amateurs through the installation process step-by-step so they don't accidentally damage their system.

CDs and DVDs do not have the capacity to hold PC backups and are not all that convenient.

The two most common interfaces for hooking up external drives to your computer are USB and FireWire with eSata now becoming popular also. USB has been around for years and are standard on just about all computers today while FireWire ports are newer and if you use a digital video camera with your computer you probably already have one. In terms of access speeds the latest eSata standard offers the fastest connection however that comes with a price. USB 2.0 and Firewire can cover most of your general needs without having to upgrade your system with a new eSata card. Any of the interfaces will do the job however be sure to purchase an external hard drive with the same type of port that your computer has. Your backup drive should have a capacity at least as big as your computer's largest hard drive. That will leave you with plenty of room to back up your important files or mirror/clone your current drive. You can also buy an external hard drive case and mount an internal hard drive inside it. This method will give you a choice of brands and models, and if anything goes wrong with your internal hard drive, you can simply install the external one inside your computer to replace it.

Having a portable memory drive means you don't have to sacrifice mobility for security, though, making flash drives an ideal solution for business people on the go. These are great to have when traveling abroad, too. If you should happen to need a secure link to personal data, are operating outside your network range or should lose your valuables, you can keep a flash drive handy containing ID and serial numbers for personal devices. To ensure this information isn't stolen as well, having a locked flash drive can keep anyone from viewing your files should the drive fall into the wrong hands. Tiny and portable, they easily slip into a pants or coat pocket, in a computer bag or purse, and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. External keypads add an additional level of security to portable memory, meaning a viewer must first input a numerical code to gain access to files. These in turn can be encrypted and password protected, deterring serious threats to personal security. Flash drives are also cost-effective. You can securely store a few dozen gigabytes of data for less than $30, and these devices range in storage capacity, price and overall size - equal to the amount you're willing to invest. Some even have special features like lanyards, locks, belt clips and key fobs to make them easier to carry and keep track of. Having a way to handle and maintain personal information is essential in a digital age, but not everyone wants the world to be privy to their data.

You may believe that your typing technique requires improvement, but more often than not faulty hardware is the root of your discomfort. Not every model has wrist supports and you can hurt your arms while you type without assistance. Ergonomic keyboards are designed to help you use your computer without any pain. These models have larger bases, letting you rest your wrists and palms while typing. Instead of uncomfortably hovering over your keyboard, your hands have the necessary support to prevent any strain and reduce the likelihood of developing physical ailments like carpal tunnel syndrome. Pads are commonly found on gaming keyboards as those are meant for more casual use. During a marathon game session, players must usually enter a great deal of key commands. With a standard keyboard, this can lead to pain or discomfort, as their hands continually move without support or rest. Some gaming models, by contrast, have features that can improve a gamer's performance as well. Wireless keyboards are also available - these ensure that users aren't tethered to their desks. If you have a large enough screen, you can use your device while sitting away from your computer. Working without wires also allows you to find a relaxed position, so you aren't confined to a single table. Buying a new keyboard can improve your typing proficiency, whether you're writing a term paper or playing a video game. The right device can raise your comfort levels while also making it easier to use your computer through key commands. Brands featured at Newegg include Microsoft, KeyTronic, Adesso, Logitech and many others. Available in multiple styles and versions you can find one to suit your unique needs rather it's multimedia, gaming, or just looking for the latest new thing. At Newegg you'll find what you need.

This makes it ideal for devices such as digital cameras where batteries go dead often. With being able to retain data even when power is lost you can rest assured that all your pictures will still be kept safe on the memory card. Examples of flash memory cards include Secure Digital (SD) memory cards, Compact Flash (CF) memory cards, and Sony's Memory Sticks (MS, M2, MS Duo, MS Pro, and MS Pro Duo) to name a few. Other examples of proprietary and permanent flash memory devices include memory cards for video gaming systems. The Benefits of Flash Memory Flash memory is extremely small, fast, lightweight, and makes no noise or have any moving parts, unlike hard drives. However, hard disks can hold considerably more data and its cost per megabyte is much cheaper although prices are quickly dropping as capacity grows larger for flash devices daily. Yet flash memory is quite reliable and allows you to specify which data you want to keep. USB flash drives are known as the floppy disks of the 21st century. You can see people walking around with them dangling from key chains, backpacks, and even around their necks. These are more resistant to physical abuse than the media cards used in digital cameras. They're also an improvement over optical storage like CDs and DVDs, which are easily scratched. Prices of the drives have come down so much that many companies give them to clients instead of printing reports and wasting paper and ink. In some schools, students are required to have them. At Newegg, we stock a wide variety of flash memory.

Even wireless devices need to recharge from time to time, and only solar-powered technology can run without being anchored occasionally to a power source. With so many devices demanding electrical attention, there just aren't enough outlets in any given home to accommodate all of them. That's why power strips are so essential. Any computer, home entertainment system or kitchen appliance will need one or more sockets for each device incorporated in a suite of tools. Some may need a half dozen or more just to achieve basic functionality. Power strips take a single wall outlet and turn it into a hub for devices, providing 2 or 3 extra sockets for extension cord models, or upwards of 10 to 12 for high-traffic areas. Some of these are also outfitted with surge protectors and backup power alerts. These strips will automatically switch off if they detect a jump in electrical current, protecting all devices attached to it. Others will also supply a small amount of energy for a short period and issue an audible chime to alert people nearby that an event has occurred and power needs to be restored. Other safety features also include protective caps to prevent accidental electrocution from an exposed socket, which is great for households with pets or small children. These tools can also help save on your electricity bill. Instead of struggling to manually unplug and reconnect each device when you aren't using it, you can simply flip the power switch on the strip and turn everything off or back on again at once. Power strips are safe, versatile and provide necessary electricity to all the utilities in your home.

KVM stands for keyboard, video, mouse. The keyboard, video, and mouse set collectively is called a \"console.\" KVM switches allow you to connect a console to more than one computer. You simply connect your console cables to the output jacks of the switch and connect the switch to the connections on your computer that the keyboard mouse and monitor would normally be plugged into. It's that simple. KVM Switches Let You Switch between Consoles To switch consoles, you just push a button on the switch and it allows you to use the other console. KVM switches save you money because you won't have to purchase separate keyboards, mice, and monitors for each computer you use. It makes it very easy when one person uses more than one computer at work, for example. They are also useful for server farms with one staff person accessing each computer periodically, one at a time.

Most people use their computers as gateways to the internet, so it can be frustrating if they can't go online because they can't find an ethernet cable. Consumers can buy wireless cards for laptops so their devices can connect with a signal from anywhere. These cards need to be installed to a computer's motherboard to use a wireless signal. Many of the available models come with tutorials and instruction guides, so even shoppers who aren't tech-savvy can easily install their new purchase. Laptop wireless cards act as internal receivers, allowing a computer to connect to the internet over the air without an ethernet cord. Users who are on the go need this added convenience so their devices can be fully functional anywhere there's a wireless signal. For example, college students can install a card so their laptops work in class and in the library - not just in their dorm rooms or apartments. A laptop must be within a certain proximity to a Wi-Fi router to receive the signal, as the card itself does not generate web connectivity. Fortunately, many establishments, ranging from coffee shops to public libraries, provide wireless web access, so everyone can find a place to go online. For users who want to add an ethernet connection to their notebook, there are cards with jacks for cords. Manufacturers have begun producing slim laptops that remove ethernet ports to reduce the devices' overall weight. Much like a wireless card, these units are installed internally but have an external attachment intended for a wired connection. You should make sure the wireless card you're thinking about purchasing matches your computer's hardware specifications.

Achieving full functionality over variable connection volumes and different distances means giving it all the bridges necessary to send and receive data, be it within a local area or over a wide network. Various connections will require different kinds of ethernet cables and other cords, so determining your system needs should always be the first step. Ethernet cable comes in different categories and can meet various needs depending on what you select. Cat5 cables as well as cat6 cables are composed of a twisted pair structure, meaning a coupled set of wires is wrapped within a protective insulation casing. This design helps cancel out electronic interference and allows data to be carried securely over large physical distances. The color of the insulation casing can tell you how many twists per meter the cable has, what kind of wiring is present, the kind of connecting head it is compatible with and what uses it can handle. Cat5 cables have largely been replaced by cat5e, or enhanced cables, and cat6 cables also come in cat6a, or augmented, capacity. All variations offer a maximum length of 100 meters, but cat5/5e offers support of up to 100 MHz while cat6 can handle up to 250 MHz and cat6a is approved at 500 MHz. The cat5 cables also are unshielded, meaning interference stands a better chance of breaking the data stream if housed in an environment with many other competing signals.

All those threats. All those data security issues. You want the cloud, but you're afraid of DropBox, and that's understandable, but you want your own cloud. In a world where we can have everything customized, from our electronics to our cars, pets, homes, clothes and our own bodies, there's no reason you can't have a storage solution that's as cheap, effective and accessible as the cloud without worrying about someone else's terms of service or use agreements. That's why network attached storage is such a handy product for those in the know. Network-attached storage (NAS) is data storage or a data storage device, such as a hard drive or RAID array, connected to a computer network, providing data access to different network clients. When you have a few computers working in tandem, it's essential that they have access to the same collaborative tools and files necessary to get projects completed. An enterprise-level solution like NAS gives all these machines access to the same documents whenever they need, so long as they can access the network. Wired or wireless options are possible with network attached storage. Wi-Fi capable, internet-ready and able to house a few disks worth of data (which you'll likely have to buy separately), these can be isolated from the online world if you so choose, or made accessible if you see fit. They allow not only sharing of key information but also devices like scanners, printers and fax machines. NAS Systems NAS systems contain one or more hard disks, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID arrays (redundant arrays of inexpensive/independent disks). NAS devices remove the responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network. NAS provides both storage and file systems. This is often contrasted with SAN (Storage Area Network) devices, which provide only block-based storage and leaves filesystem concerns on the \"client\" side. SAN protocols include SCSI, Fibre Channel, iSCSI, ATA over Ethernet, or HyperSCSI. Flexibility & Scalability Fit for personal or small business use, network attached storage is flexible, scalable and ready for whatever in-house storage and devices you can throw at it. Reasonably priced, they even outmatch some online vendor contracts and can outlast an outage, too. Newegg has Network storage / NAS from the world\u2019s best Network storage / NAS manufacturers, including Buffalo, Cavalry, D-Link, Hammer Storage, Intel, iomega, LaCie, Linksys, Maxtor, Netgear, QNAP, Thecus, Western Digital and Synology.", "parent_text": "Networking", "keyword_density": {"network": "2.6", "network attached storage": "2.8", "storage nas": "1.4", "storage": "3.5", "nas": "1.9", "network attached storage nas": "0.9"}, "department_id": 1},

Many electronic items from televisions to game consoles require a web signal to reach the device's true potential. Unfortunately not every home has Wi-Fi available and not every room has a phone jack, limiting the number of gadgets that can access the internet. It can be expensive and time consuming to run additional ethernet cables through walls so each device has access to the internet. A powerline adapter could be the cost-effective solution homeowners are looking for to make their web connection available all over their house. An internet connection can be shared via existing wires with powerline networking. Simply plugging an adapter into an outlet near the web signal's origin point and then putting additional adapters in other rooms allows homeowners to bring web access to their entire house. For example, if an internet router is in the kitchen it wouldn't be possible to go online in any other room via a wired connection. A power adapter basically turns an outlet into an internet router so you can play video games online in your bedroom. Every room has an electrical outlet, but phone jacks are probably in one or two places. These adapters create a whole new network in a home without running wires all through a residence. This could be convenient to consumers who move frequently, like college students, and don't want to pay for an installation that they won't use for too long. Powerline networking allows consumers to make the most of every device that can access web content. Instead of paying for an expensive wireless connection from an internet provider, shoppers can install the adapters themselves and enjoy all the best features of their favorite gadgets.

Getting printers set up and accessible within a network structure can be frustrating, especially when working with remote servers and accessing machines, but print servers can assist with getting these devices working more quickly. Whether wired or wireless, these devices plug in to printer network connection ports, granting usage for authorized users and those within the system. As not every manufacturer makes printers compatible with every kind of network or every other print device on the market, a print server can override this incompatibility, making a device usable as long as it has the right adapter. It's also great for offices with multiple printers. A network can host so many machines that it's cumbersome to have all print jobs routed to the same printer, especially when a device is built to handle multiple functions. A printer can also be a scanner, copier and fax machine, making it necessary to have more than one machine to fit unit-task needs, so routing them all into a single client can make it easy for users in a vast network to select a device that's not busy. This also helps when one of these printers inevitably gets jammed. Print servers hook devices into a network in a way that makes them most useful to the greatest number of users.

There is a variety of services available that provide internet and other media to home and professional users, but the boxes they provide usually aren't the top of the line. A standard modem will carry a 6MHz signal just fine, but upstream data won't travel as well from a sub-par device as it could from some of the top models.

Plasma monitors don't come in desktop sizes, and represent higher costs, weight, and energy consumption. Most homes and offices use monitors between 15 to 20 inches, though larger widescreen monitors increase productivity at work and enjoyment of games and movies at home. Newegg carries a huge variety of LCD monitors from Samsung, NEC, ViewSonic, Acer, HP, Hanns-G, ASUS, and many other major brands. Pros and Cons LCD Monitors are thin, lightweight and easy to move, and some are wall-mountable, getting them completely off your desk, providing drastically greater options for work or play. Adjustable monitor stands also offer increased ergonomics. LCD monitors have a steadier, flicker-free picture, causing far less eyestrain, and are a blessing to users who spend long hours at their screens. They use less energy than plasma monitors or CRTs. What should you consider before purchase? LCD monitors are currently available in a variety of screen sizes . A larger viewing area will often provide support for higher resolutions, which translate into more on the screen at once. LCD screen sizes are measured in inches along the diagonal of the screen. Newegg carries LCD monitors from 15\" all the way up to 52\"! Native resolution is the maximum resolution (detail level, in pixels) an LCD monitor can support. A monitor provides the best viewing experience when working in its native resolution. Aspect ratio is the width to height proportion of a display. Non-widescreen LCDs have an aspect ratio of 5:4, similar to a standard television set's aspect ratio of 4:3. Widescreen LCDs boast 16:9 or 16:10 dimensions to better display movie formats. The response time is the speed at which an LCD monitor's pixels change from one color to the next and back again. Response time is measured in ms (milliseconds). The quicker an LCD monitor's response time, the less likelihood there is for ghosting or after images appearing when displaying fast-paced images (games and movies). We recommend 8ms or better for high-performance gaming and multimedia applications. Brightness (luminosity) is often measured in candelas or cd/m2. Most LCD monitors today can provide over 200 cd/m2, which is more than sufficient for normal use. Games and movies may benefit from somewhat higher brightness levels. A higher contrast ratio allows a monitor to provide a greater range of dark and light details. Viewing angle is the greatest angle (horizontal or vertical) from which a user can view an LCD screen at an acceptable image quality. A wide viewing angle enables a group of people to view the screen at once or enables a user with greater viewing flexibility. LCD monitors are usually equipped with one or two types of connectors for connecting to your PC. D-Sub Connectors transfer analog signals and are still very popular as they are compatible with most video cards. DVI Connectors transfer a video card's digital output directly for a superior signal. The DVI connector is mainstream equipment on newer video cards and on an increasing number of new LCD monitors. HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors are necessary for displays with HD resolution approaching that of HDTV, from 780-1080 lines per inch, and they're backwards-compatible with DVI systems.", "parent_text": "Monitors", "keyword_density": {"lcd": "3.0", "monitors": "2.4", "lcd monitors": "3.5"}, "department_id": 1},

Normally, an access point connects the wireless network from a fixed location using cables. A single access point sends and receives data between the wireless LAN and the wired network infrastructure. End-users would then access the wireless LAN through the wireless network adapters in their computers. Wireless Network Adapters Every network adapter supports either Wi-Fi (wireless) or Ethernet (wired) standards. At Newegg, we stock both types of network adapters so you can get what you need whether your network is wired or wireless. Wireless networks can be less expensive to implement than wired networks, because there is less labor and fewer materials involved. Schools and nonprofits tend to benefit from these cost savings, and they're becoming increasingly popular with multiple-computer households.. They're simple to install and can reach places that might be difficult to wire. If you're in a temporary space, their portability is an asset. You can use a mobile router to connect to a wired LAN and to anyone in your company who is networked. Wireless LANs are also very scalable, so you can build on if you need to connect several buildings. You simply add more access points and wireless network adapters. Improvements in data transfer rates (802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g and the newer 802.11n) mean you are getting networking speed rivaling your wired networks. Newer computers usually come with wireless network adapters already installed, but you can add one if you don't have one already. You can also purchase network adapters together with routers.

Many electronic items from televisions to game consoles require a web signal to reach the device's true potential. Unfortunately not every home has Wi-Fi available and not every room has a phone jack, limiting the number of gadgets that can access the internet. It can be expensive and time consuming to run additional ethernet cables through walls so each device has access to the internet. A powerline adapter could be the cost-effective solution homeowners are looking for to make their web connection available all over their house. An internet connection can be shared via existing wires with powerline networking. Simply plugging an adapter into an outlet near the web signal's origin point and then putting additional adapters in other rooms allows homeowners to bring web access to their entire house. For example, if an internet router is in the kitchen it wouldn't be possible to go online in any other room via a wired connection. A power adapter basically turns an outlet into an internet router so you can play video games online in your bedroom. Every room has an electrical outlet, but phone jacks are probably in one or two places. These adapters create a whole new network in a home without running wires all through a residence. This could be convenient to consumers who move frequently, like college students, and don't want to pay for an installation that they won't use for too long. Powerline networking allows consumers to make the most of every device that can access web content. Instead of paying for an expensive wireless connection from an internet provider, shoppers can install the adapters themselves and enjoy all the best features of their favorite gadgets.

If your wireless connection is weak, the devices may not work well and you won''''t be able to enjoy all of your favorite features. Some houses may be too large for a standard router to supply sufficient coverage over the entire area. A wireless repeater could boost the signal strength to make sure that even the furthest corners are covered. A wireless signal degrades as it travels through the air. As a computer or tablet is moved further away from the Wi-Fi origin point, the strength of the internet connection will decrease. A wireless range extender gives the signal another broadcast point for an increase in strength over a larger area. Most of these extenders practically double the range of coverage. Every room in the house will have a strong wireless signal, so devices can be brought anywhere without fear of losing the connection. Instead of being forced to stay close to your wireless router to stream a movie on your laptop, you could go upstairs without dealing with constant pauses while the file loads over a weak signal. No matter where you are, you''''ll be to go online quickly and not worry about leaving the network area. Different range extenders are available based on your connection needs. Some modems plug directly into the wall, so they''''re perfect for a house that doesn''''t have a lot of shelf space. Other repeaters have long cords, so they don''''t have to be too close to an outlet to work. Boosting your wireless signal has never been easier.

There is a variety of services available that provide internet and other media to home and professional users, but the boxes they provide usually aren't the top of the line. A standard modem will carry a 6MHz signal just fine, but upstream data won't travel as well from a sub-par device as it could from some of the top models. Cable modems work best for those receiving their service through a television or multi-service provider, though in some cases a DSL modem is necessary. These carry TV, internet and even phone with a single connection, and the higher the demand for a device, the stronger it needs to be. Some of the best modems offer up to 24Mbps download speed with 2Mbps upload streams as well. All providers will carry a slower upload speed, regardless of brand or carrier, as it's largely assumed that we're downloading a significant amount more than we're sending back to the web. That speeds up the process, though, making room for the utility most users want most. These devices also will usually have at least one Ethernet port, though some are USB compatible. LED lights on the exterior of the case aren't standard, but purchasing a modem with this feature will help assist with diagnostic tests if a problem should arise.

This is an inconvenience for those who need their devices to work efficiently and accommodate all needs. If you have too many accessories and not enough docks, a USB hub will provide the additional support you need. A hub uses one USB port on the computer itself but provides multiple ports that link with other devices - much the way a power strip creates additional electrical outlets by working from one. After purchasing a network hub, every peripheral device can stay connected to a laptop. You can connect an external hard drive, DVD burner, printer and smartphone to a computer via a single USB connection and still have extra space for more accessories. Users can leave all their peripherals attached to the hub for more convenient connection and detachment. Instead of unplugging multiple items, consumers only have to remove a USB hub's plug. This is perfect for those who need their computers to travel, such as college students who bring their notebooks to class or workers who need their laptops in the office. There are different styles of plugs to meet the needs of every shopper. Some ports are large and have over 10 USB slots so they might be best utilized in a stationary environment, while others only feature a couple of access points for more mobile use. Other network hubs are just a series of wires so consumers don't have to carry a bulky device. Peripheral accessories help users enjoy their laptops' best features.

It allows your computer to \"talk\" to the network and the network to communicate with your computer. Each computer that is attached to a network requires a network interface card or chip. They help computers communicate with servers and other computers on the network. Usually, these fit into expansion slots of CPUs, unless they're pre-installed or integrated into the motherboard. Some are external and attach to computers through serial or parallel ports. NICs for laptops are usually external. An interface card takes data from a PC, converts it into data \"frames\" that are broadcast onto the network, and sends it to another interface card. That card receives the frames, converts them into data, and sends it to that PC. What to Look for in Network Interface Cards When you are looking to build a LAN or upgrade or replace it, the NIC should be one of the first things you consider. You need to think about compatibility with operating systems, ease of installation, and price, especially for large company installations where you'll need many cards. NIC cards are usually Ethernet adapters. Others support other protocols such as ATM. One other consideration before purchasing network interface cards is the speed that they support. For example, you may want an interface card that supports 10 Mbps traditional, or fast Ethernet, and on up to 10/20Gbps! You should also know the type of ports you are connecting them to and the standards your systems support.

Setting up a wireless access point creates a new source for a wireless signal, so that every Wi-Fi enabled gadget can go online successfully. The device acts as a bridge for the internet connection so it can cover a larger area without losing strength. An access point syncs with a wireless router to rebroadcast the signal it receives. Unlike a PC, which needs to be near a modem for a fast internet connection, a wireless bridge has a direct connection to the Wi-Fi router so it can be far enough away to increase the coverage area. Some devices cannot support local gadgets and require an additional ethernet port to allow wireless devices to go online. These models are usually smaller so you aren't losing much additional space because of the second unit. For offices and workspaces, there are access points that can be mounted to the wall or ceiling and don't have to sit on an employee's desk. The network coverage area will be larger as well, because the bridge is close enough to a barrier to prevent it from blocking the signal. Residential users must to consider what type of access point meets their needs.

Electrical issues can be devastating - whether it's a power outage that causes work to be lost, a blown fuse that shuts the system down or anything in between. An uninterrupted power supply prevents disruptions from electrical malfunctions. While the devices don't hold a long-lasting charge, users will have enough time to save files and properly turn off a computer to avoid any damage or find and activate an alternate power source. Unlike a generator, there is no lag time between a loss of power and activation with UPS power supplies. The back-ups store electricity that is immediately shared with any connected computer when primary power is lost. This prevents system damage by avoiding sudden changes in voltage. Hard drives can be damaged by electrical losses and surges. UPS battery backups maintain a steady rate of power for a computer and can extend the life of any piece of equipment by eliminating the long-term harm electrical fluctuations can cause. Shoppers should consider their needs when researching a UPS device. Some back-up systems last longer than others, which would be better for users who don't have an alternate power source available. Consumers who have a secondary electrical supply should buy a device that lasts long enough to activate the other power source. If you're worried about the longevity of the UPS, there are models with screens and diagnostic tools.

They are the circuitry involved in running hard disks and getting them to do what they are supposed to. On IDE drives, the hard drive controller is actually part of the drive. In older hard drives, controllers were separate boards. With a typical IDE hard drive, you can have up to four devices directly connected to the motherboard. An example would be the hard drive, floppy drive, CD-ROM, and DVD drives. If all the spots are used up, you would need to purchase another hard drive controller card. Sometimes the hard drive controller can fail and you will need to replace it. You need the same type of controller as your hard drive. For example, IDE drives are only compatible with IDE controllers, and SCSI drives need SCSI controllers. Hard Drive Controller Errors If you get an error that says \"HDD controller failure\" upon booting your computer, it usually means the hard disk drive (HDD) controller has failed. Sometimes, you will get a 1701 error, which means the hard drive controller and the drive are having trouble communicating. This might be due to a loose connection. The best way to avoid losing data is to prevent loss by backing up. With the low cost of external hard drives this is a ideal solution. By making regular copies of your important files, or by cloning your entire hard drive setup, you'll save yourself a ton of trouble in the event that your hard drive ever goes bad.

That's why network attached storage is such a handy product for those in the know. Network-attached storage (NAS) is data storage or a data storage device, such as a hard drive or RAID array, connected to a computer network, providing data access to different network clients. When you have a few computers working in tandem, it's essential that they have access to the same collaborative tools and files necessary to get projects completed. An enterprise-level solution like NAS gives all these machines access to the same documents whenever they need, so long as they can access the network. Wired or wireless options are possible with network attached storage. Wi-Fi capable, internet-ready and able to house a few disks worth of data (which you'll likely have to buy separately), these can be isolated from the online world if you so choose, or made accessible if you see fit. They allow not only sharing of key information but also devices like scanners, printers and fax machines. NAS Systems NAS systems contain one or more hard disks, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID arrays (redundant arrays of inexpensive/independent disks). NAS devices remove the responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network. NAS provides both storage and file systems. This is often contrasted with SAN (Storage Area Network) devices, which provide only block-based storage and leaves filesystem concerns on the \"client\" side. SAN protocols include SCSI, Fibre Channel, iSCSI, ATA over Ethernet, or HyperSCSI. Flexibility & Scalability Fit for personal or small business use, network attached storage is flexible, scalable and ready for whatever in-house storage and devices you can throw at it.

AMD Motherboard Chipsets (990FX, 990X, 970, A88X, A78, A58 & 760G) for Desktops are specifically designed to unlock and maximize the performance of its top notch microprocessors, such as: AMD FX Processors, A-Series APU, Phenom II Processors, Athlon II Processors and entry-level Sempron Processors, in different socket designs (939/AM3+/FM1/FM2 & FM2+). By combining the AMD Radeon Graphics Cards with Eyefinity and CrossFire multi-GPU technologies, you will get immersed in gaming, productivity and entertainment on up to six displays simultaneously. Understanding Motherboard Specifications Motherboard (alternatively known as mainboard, system board or logic board), the \u2018mother\u2019 of all components, is the main printed circuit board found in personal computers, workstations and other computing system. Its embedded chipset holds a key function to connect many of the crucial pc components of the system, such as CPU, Memory, Hard Drive, Graphics Card and other I/O cards. And also, it provides the connectivity for other external peripherals thru I/O connectors, like keyboard and mouse. Each chipset has its own unique design determining system performance, upgradability and connectivity. Form factor is another crucial element to determine for expandability. It\u2019s important to acknowledge AMD chipsets designed for housing only AMD microprocessors (Please check the motherboard specifications for CPU Socket compatibility).

You can still purchase them and install them on your existing computer. Even manufacturers like Dell, that have stopped making them standard on new computers, still offer them as an option. Another reason floppy drives have hung on for so long is because older operating systems support them. For older systems, there is no option to use newer media like CD, DVD, or flash drives. For people with older systems or with much of their data stored on disks, there is still a need for floppy drives. Floppy Drives Are Still an Option CD-ROMs were the first technology to begin to replace floppy drives. They hold nearly 650 times as much as a single floppy diskette, and are as portable and inexpensive as floppy disks. The zip drive, only made by Iomega, did not catch on as widely as CD-ROMs did. Today most software comes on CD or is downloadable. There is little need for people to use floppy drives. For the transportation factor, writeable CDs are just as mobile as floppies and store much more data. USB \"thumb\" drives that use flash memory are also quite portable and even more durable than CDs, which are prone to scratching. They cost very little and hold much more than floppies. However, many of us still have old data on floppies and that's why floppy drives are still a necessary computer accessory.", "parent_text": "Backup Devices & Media", "keyword_density": {"floppy": "3.6", "floppy drives": "5.7", "drives": "3.6"}, "department_id": 1},

However, they are basically obsolete because you can transport data through email or over the Web now. Many computer manufacturers are selling computers without floppy disk drives. You can still order one as an option if you need one, but they don't come standard anymore. CD and DVD drives allow for storage that holds many times the amount a single floppy drive diskette can hold. CDs are cheap and can save large files and applications, such as PowerPoint presentations and music. In order to write to CDs, you need to have a CD-RW drive, also known as a CD burner. Alternatives to Floppy Drive Diskettes The latest technology for removable storage is the portable hard drive. Using flash memory, these drives are easy to use--they simply plug into your computer's USB port. They can store over one GB and are more durable than CDs and DVDs, which are vulnerable to scratching. Today there are more choices than ever for storing data. Before purchasing storage drives, be sure they have large enough capacities for your needs.

Even wireless devices need to recharge from time to time, and only solar-powered technology can run without being anchored occasionally to a power source. With so many devices demanding electrical attention, there just aren't enough outlets in any given home to accommodate all of them. That's why power strips are so essential. Any computer, home entertainment system or kitchen appliance will need one or more sockets for each device incorporated in a suite of tools. Some may need a half dozen or more just to achieve basic functionality. Power strips take a single wall outlet and turn it into a hub for devices, providing 2 or 3 extra sockets for extension cord models, or upwards of 10 to 12 for high-traffic areas. Some of these are also outfitted with surge protectors and backup power alerts. These strips will automatically switch off if they detect a jump in electrical current, protecting all devices attached to it. Others will also supply a small amount of energy for a short period and issue an audible chime to alert people nearby that an event has occurred and power needs to be restored. Other safety features also include protective caps to prevent accidental electrocution from an exposed socket, which is great for households with pets or small children. These tools can also help save on your electricity bill. Instead of struggling to manually unplug and reconnect each device when you aren't using it, you can simply flip the power switch on the strip and turn everything off or back on again at once. Power strips are safe, versatile and provide necessary electricity to all the utilities in your home. Be it for recreation or practical use, they are a reliable way of multiplying the number of things you can do in any given room.", "parent_text": "Computer Accessories", "keyword_density": {"strips": "1.3", "power strips": "1.9", "power": "2.6"}, "department_id": 1},

You simply connect your console cables to the output jacks of the switch and connect the switch to the connections on your computer that the keyboard mouse and monitor would normally be plugged into.

It makes it very easy when one person uses more than one computer at work, for example. They are also useful for server farms with one staff person accessing each computer periodically, one at a time.

Achieving full functionality over variable connection volumes and different distances means giving it all the bridges necessary to send and receive data, be it within a local area or over a wide network. Various connections will require different kinds of ethernet cables and other cords, so determining your system needs should always be the first step. Ethernet cable comes in different categories and can meet various needs depending on what you select. Cat5 cables as well as cat6 cables are composed of a twisted pair structure, meaning a coupled set of wires is wrapped within a protective insulation casing. This design helps cancel out electronic interference and allows data to be carried securely over large physical distances. The color of the insulation casing can tell you how many twists per meter the cable has, what kind of wiring is present, the kind of connecting head it is compatible with and what uses it can handle. Cat5 cables have largely been replaced by cat5e, or enhanced cables, and cat6 cables also come in cat6a, or augmented, capacity. All variations offer a maximum length of 100 meters, but cat5/5e offers support of up to 100 MHz while cat6 can handle up to 250 MHz and cat6a is approved at 500 MHz. The cat5 cables also are unshielded, meaning interference stands a better chance of breaking the data stream if housed in an environment with many other competing signals. Determining which cord is right for your system will require accessing your space, planning your network requirements and pricing each option to find the one that most matches your performance and communication expectations.", "parent_text": "Computer Accessories", "keyword_density": {"cables": "2.9", "network": "0.7"}, "department_id": 1},

Users need the access port to watch DVDs, burn discs, copy music files and install software. As with most technology, the devices are sensitive and can malfunction, leading to the need for repair or replacement. For consumers that have experienced electrical failure with their CD/DVD drive, there are replacement drives available that can be easily installed into the old device's slot. This is a cost-effective alternative to hiring a technician or sending a computer to a retailer or manufacturer for repairs. The most important part of buying a new CD Rom drive is finding out if it is compatible with your system. You can check by reading your computer's hardware specifications and matching them against what a new drive requires. Ultra-slim notebooks and netbooks do not come with an internal DVD Rom drive, so users have no access to disc-based content. There are external drives available so consumers can watch DVDs or use a CD for storage. Most of these devices connect to a device via a USB cord. Some require two USB ports, so it's important for shoppers to buy one that matches the port availability of their computers. Being able to access content from CDs and DVDs is a necessity for most users. There is no need to buy a whole new system if a drive burns out, because they are detachable from a computer in most cases. Shoppers should research every piece of hardware before purchasing to avoid wasteful spending and the hassle of exchanging one piece of equipment for another. The first CD drive a consumer buys can be the last, by making sure it is compatible with their computer ahead of time.", "parent_text": "CD / DVD / Blu-Ray Burners & Media", "keyword_density": {"dvd": "1.7", "drives": "0.7", "cd": "2.0"}, "department_id": 1},

If your camera or camcorder doesn't have removable memory, USB and micro USB cables can get your media transferred from hardware to software devices. Network cables let you get online and share your uploaded images via the Internet. HDMI cables and USB cables connect your computer to your television and entertainment center. To get the best sound and balance out of your audio receiver and speaker system, audio/video cables like VGA splitters, basic RCA or component and composite variations, stereo and s-video cables all help you manipulate and connect hardware for maximized quality output. Extension cords are essential for larger spaces or for positioning your gaming and entertainment center with the most zen and flow, and not being tethered to the nearest outlet. To speed up your connections and make communication between devices easier, you might want to switch your USB cables to Firewire versions and try network Ethernet cords instead of basic models.

Instead of being limited to burning DVDs, you can share your home movies and photography with friends and family in a format featuring unmatched picture quality. Blu-ray discs have greater storage capacity than other file back-up methods, like DVDs and some flash drives. It is also easier to share content through a disc than giving a close friend your camera to cycle through vacation pictures or sending videos in a multimedia message from your smartphone. Blu-ray discs provide flexibility regarding which formats it can save, so users can back-up all their content regardless of how the file was saved or which program was used to create it. Unlike an external hard drive, there is no chance for a disc to malfunction electronically unless it is scratched, and the only way to lose any data is to misplace the disc. Finding the best Blu-ray burner for you means considering your needs and what would be compatible with your PC. Not every external disc writer is supported by a computer's hardware, so it's important to figure out what your equipment can work with and what would be a wasteful purchase.

If you've ever dreamed of creating an all-in-one system, audio and video cables can bring all your devices together when you've got them hooked together properly. In terms of bringing external signals into your receiver, a coaxial cable can bring you satellite or cable television, unless you're working with some old-school gaming hardware, in which case a splitter can help you hook multiples of this cable together. More recent audio and visual devices will use DVI or HDMI cables, which will provide connectivity for basically every television, computer, home theater and music device you may want to hook together. Composite cables come in a rainbow of colors to help you get high-definition video and stereo sound with just a single connection, but with HD televisions and newer gaming consoles, the variety has grown to epic proportions with endless customization possible. Firewire cables can even come in handy for connecting computers with televisions, in case you want to share your Internet experience with a group of people or just want a single monitor or television in your home to provide you with all your entertainment needs. Creating a fluid home entertainment experience can't be easier with proper audio and video cables to get maximum synergy going with your whole suite of technological toys.

Smartphones, tablets and laptops are all prone to running out of power at the exact wrong moment, but it's not always possible to go home and connect your gadget to its charger. Fortunately, there are portable cables and AC adapters that are compatible with your car so you can keep your electronics alive. Many smartphones connect to outlets via USB cables. There are many devices that have USB ports, so almost any device can be connected to receive a quick boost. Some models even have multiple slots so that you can simultaneously charge all of your devices rather than waiting for each one to regain power. A wall charger could be the ideal purchase if you have a couple of gadgets and not enough outlets to plug them all in at once. Alternatively, a model that can connect with your vehicle's auxiliary jack is the best option if your devices frequently die when you're on the road. Of course, you can't use a USB model charger if your gadget isn't compatible with that type of connection. For instance, the iPhone 5 features a much different pin than many other smartphones, and some Windows Phones have micro-USB slots instead of their normal-sized counterparts. Luckily, there are chargers and cables for every style of connection port. You can find the correct model for your mobile device so that you're never caught without any power. Additionally, there are models available that feature different types of plugs and covers so that you only need one charger for all of your gadgets. Instead of carrying dozens of cables, you only need a single cord with interchangeable fixtures. It can be more convenient to only require one adapter.", "parent_text": "Cables", "keyword_density": {"chargers and cables": "1.0", "cables": "1.3"}, "department_id": 1},

It's that simple. KVM Switches Let You Switch between Consoles To switch consoles, you just push a button on the switch and it allows you to use the other console. KVM switches save you money because you won't have to purchase separate keyboards, mice, and monitors for each computer you use. It makes it very easy when one person uses more than one computer at work, for example. They are also useful for server farms with one staff person accessing each computer periodically, one at a time. When buying KVM switches, it is important to fully understand your needs before you buy anything. Make sure the switch you choose will support your monitor refresh rates and resolution so that the signals are not degraded.", "parent_text": "Computer Cables", "keyword_density": {"kvm": "2.4", "kvm switches": "3.2"}, "department_id": 1},

It was the first big change in computer case and motherboard design in a long time. ATX took over AT completely as a standard form factor for new systems. Version 2.2 of the ATX form factor was issued in 2004. The computer case or chassis encases and protects all computer components installed within it and provides a unified external appearance. It therefore plays a very significant role in the total computer system. Not only does the computer case affect the type and number of components that can be installed, its layout and design also determines the cooling performance and reliability of the entire system. The massive selection of computer cases on Newegg.com ensures that you will be able to find something made just for you, regardless of the application: normal home use, office use or power gaming/DIYing.

Consumers want the perfect screen, audio system and media hub. Some users build their own home theater PC (HTPC), so they have equipment that meets their exact specifications. The system should be stored in a HTPC case, so it's not just a loose collection of wires and processors. Finding the best HTPC case comes down to what the system demands and the consumer's preferences. Some storage units have more ports and input bays than others, so users need to consider what their HTPC is going to be used for and what type of connections it demands. Cases also come with different types of available connections, like USB ports and audio jacks for microphones and headphones. Size should be one of your bigger concerns when choosing a media center PC case. Figure out how much space your system will need to function properly and remain secure. This allows users to avoid redesigning a PC's setup because of an excess or a lack of storage space. For shoppers who have an eye on the overall aesthetic of their home theater, different styles of cases are available. If you want a case to go unnoticed, there are basic black models that disappear into the shadows. Different colors are available if you want your HTPC case to stick out or match the color scheme in the room. There are even some modeled after retro radios, to make the system as fun as it is functional. Finding the right home theater pc case doesn't have to be difficult. Consider all of your system's needs before buying anything to ensure that your purchase is the correct one.", "parent_text": "Computer Cases", "keyword_density": {"cases": "0.7", "htpc": "1.7"}, "department_id": 1},
